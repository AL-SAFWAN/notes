   refer to words that denote a person, place, thing, or abstract concept (ilm).

   In a sentence, nouns are crucial because they are used to:
   - identifying
     - subjects - who's doing
     - objects - who's receiving
     - attributes within a sentence (description)
   - imparts meanings independently without the need to denote time.
