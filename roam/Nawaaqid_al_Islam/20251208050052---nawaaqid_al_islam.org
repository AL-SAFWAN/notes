#+TITLE: The Invalidators of Islam (Nawaaqid al‑Islam)
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhaab (d. 1206 AH)
Bismillah - In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.


* Introduction

** Know that the nullifiers of Islam are ten
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a349740d-fe15-40ee-b09f-8058e651ec50
:END:
- these are the main nullifiers of his time that the author listed
  - they would often place them at the end of the chapters of fiqh
    - the nullifiers vary in number from scholar to scholar
      - but we find these in our time as well, and others like evolution and feminism

** The danger of the nullifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9ca2a36a-70d1-45e1-8fe8-b46788e97514
:END:
- these are things that destroy a person’s Islām and take them out of the fold of Islām
  - their actions will be nullified in this world and the Hereafter
    - ḥadīth: “Whoever changes his religion, then kill him.”
  - we learn about them so we can stay away from them

** Īmān – definition and nature
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       be33e4e5-9288-4ae0-9284-ec8afd69c041
:END:
*** Components of īmān
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       547904f2-6de7-4920-b1f6-24d746d69674
:END:
- īmān is:
  - belief
  - statement
  - action
- actions are a part of īmān
  - only Imām Abū Ḥanīfah said they are not *part* of īmān, but he still affirmed the actions
    - he said īmān is belief, and the actions are from the Sharī‘ah
- īmān:
  - increases with obedience
  - decreases with disobedience

*** The heart and the limbs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       69b52d57-c66f-4f24-b5f0-35801615b314
:END:
- the heart is the reflection of the actions, and the actions are a reflection of the heart
  - e.g. the ḥadīth about the “piece of flesh”:
    - [[id:11b2fdf3-682d-48b9-b5ef-4cf4665800b0][There is a piece of flesh in the body; if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good, but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt, and that is the heart.]]
  - you will be accountable for your statements, beliefs and actions

*** Types of people with respect to heart and actions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e92847e9-1aa7-47c1-8e49-82172ab159c1
:END:
- good heart and good action → Muslim
- good heart and bad action → does not exist
  - if your heart is upright then we will see it in your actions
- bad heart and good action → munāfiq (hypocrite)
- bad heart and bad action → kāfir (disbeliever)

- hence it is important to come to Allah with a pure heart

** The opposite of īmān: kufr
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6d284f24-f4ff-4a31-a728-780f5a77a6ff
:END:
*** What is kufr?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       45a5fb7d-f17d-4074-afa3-c7e666cf81f5
:END:
- we enter into īmān and leave kufr
- the meaning of kufr is the absence of īmān
  - also in:
    - statements and actions of the heart
    - and statements and actions of the limbs

- e.g. in the rulings of this world:
  - a person could be judged as a Muslim outwardly
    - but in their heart is disbelief and he is a munāfiq
      - his ruling in the Hereafter is that of a kāfir
  - or there could be a person who is judged as a disbeliever in this world
    - but may believe inwardly and be tested in the Hereafter

*** No joking with Islām
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1917c333-af21-4394-b2c5-6fb9a3de402d
:END:
- there is no such thing as joking about Islām
  - (e.g. the Jew at the time of Imām Aḥmad who said the testimony then said “I was joking” and was punished for apostasy)
- īmān prevents this
- certain actions will take the person out of Islām, such as:
  - imitating the kuffār in matters of pure disbelief
  - killing a prophet
  - (exceptions:)
    - if you are deceiving them in war
    - or using a resemblance *for a ḥājah* (valid need) without intending their religion
  - shirk (associating partners with Allah)
  - turning away from the religion completely
  - pride and arrogance against the truth
  - mocking and joking about Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ)
  - making something ḥarām ḥalāl or ḥalāl ḥarām (changing the Sharī‘ah)
  - nifāq (hypocrisy in belief)

*** Takfīr based on Sharī‘ah, not desire

:END:
        
**** Principle from al-Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c31bb60c-fb64-409f-927d-99b1d07cd86b
:END:
- al-Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ: a person cannot be judged to be a disbeliever just by our minds,
  - rather only by way of the Sharī‘ah
- pronouncing disbelief (takfīr) on someone is the right of Allah

- if someone calls you a kāfir, you cannot simply call him a kāfir back
  - incident of Ibn Taymiyyah and al-Bakrī:
    - al-Bakrī made takfīr of Ibn Taymiyyah because he did not make du‘ā’ *to* the Prophet (ﷺ)
    - people asked Ibn Taymiyyah to make takfīr of al-Bakrī in return
      - he said: takfīr is the right of Allah, so how can I make takfīr of him just because he made it of me?

**** Statement of Ibn Ḥazm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       af2b9179-3f2a-4bc6-bb55-4c9e6f504006
:END:
- Ibn Ḥazm:
  - disbelief is a description of a person’s religion
    - after the evidence has been established and the truth has reached him
      - and he still denies it, then he has disbelief

** Types of takfīr
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       11dd8a89-d1ef-467f-9bef-43fbfef73936
:END:
*** General takfīr (takfīr al-muṭlaq)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6a074d7b-a48b-4fb0-bb91-0692fe3720d2
:END:
- /takfīr al-muṭlaq/ – general takfīr:
  - “whoever does such-and-such is a disbeliever”
- this does *not* necessitate specific takfīr of a named individual
  - making general takfīr does not automatically make a specific person a kāfir

- example:
  - the Jahmiyyah: many scholars said their *beliefs* are kufr
    - they brought a specific person from the Jahmiyyah to Imām Aḥmad
      - he did not declare that individual a kāfir
      - it requires investigation

- example from Ibn Taymiyyah:
  - he said: if *I* were to say the same things as the Jahmiyyah, I would be a kāfir,
    - because I know that your statement is disbelief
    - but you are saying it because you are /jāhil/ (ignorant)
      - you will not be a disbeliever until I establish the evidence upon you
        - and then, if you still continue in these actions, then you will be a kāfir

- The fitnah of our time:
  - some groups make takfīr of another group
    - then they ask a third group: “Is that group a kāfir?”
      - if they say “no”, they make takfīr of the third group as well
        - this causes a domino effect
          - until they start fighting the Muslims

*** Specific takfīr (takfīr al-muʿayyan)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cb4c89ca-d7ff-49ea-bd89-d138d320b159
:END:
- /takfīr al-muʿayyan/ – specific takfīr:
  - declaring: “so-and-so person is a disbeliever”

** Conditions for specific takfīr (of one who attributes to Islām)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7672ae0b-d5f6-4341-8a7a-18e96fcab1e7
:END:

- there are 6 conditions of making takfīr of a specific individual
  - this is for a *Muslim* (or one who attributes himself to Islām),
    - not for Jews or Christians

*** Condition 1: The action is clear disbelief
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1cf60516-c0fa-48ac-b81f-93768b52b736
:END:
- there is clear evidence that the /action/ in discussion is clear disbelief
  - if all the scholars agree, we can say the action is kufr
  - it must be an evidence that cannot be refuted

- examples:
  - the Qādiyānī group:
    - every group of Ahl al-Sunnah agrees they are kuffār,
      since they believe a prophet came after the Prophet (ﷺ)
  - mocking an obvious symbol of the religion, like mocking the miswāk, in a way that mocks the Sharī‘ah itself

*** Condition 2: Certainty about the person’s action
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f5726f78-d118-4697-98e7-ffcd01c0bb36
:END:
- the /person/ in discussion is /certainly/ the doer of that /action/
  - if there is doubt, this condition is not satisfied
  - just because someone tells us does not mean the person is a kāfir
    - the one who told you may be mistaken
  - you have to be certain for yourself

- qāʿidah:
  - “whoever enters Islām with certainty, it cannot be removed by doubt”

- after certainty:
  - i.e. after establishing the proof against them and they are still persistent in their disbelief,
    - then they are a kāfir

*** Condition 3: Establishing the evidence upon him
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0bf32404-3ed5-4ed8-ab9c-a96295d5b5f1
:END:
- establish the /evidence/ against that /person/
  - there is no sin upon a person who makes a mistake in ignorance

- in a Muslim land (classical fiqh discussion):
  - the person may be imprisoned for 3 days
    - his doubts are removed
    - the evidence is made clear to him
  - some scholars say:
    - if there are materials to remove his doubt and he has not sought them out of laziness,
      then the proof has been established against him
  - after that, if he persists, then the ḥadd of apostasy is applied by the authorities

- hence there is a *process* and you cannot just go and kill a person

*** Condition 4: The person is mukallaf
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ef29aa87-8e20-401e-81a9-b33017e903a4
:END:
- the /person/ is a /mukallaf/:
  - sane
  - has reached the age of responsibility
  - aware of what he is saying/doing

*** Condition 5: The one making takfīr is grounded in knowledge
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       542d7493-9523-4643-916b-54bdcb7218bb
:END:
- the one who is making /takfīr/ is well-grounded in knowledge
  - the greatest calamity of the ummah is that the ignorant make takfīr of the scholars
    - e.g. the Khawārij and the Rāfiḍah

*** Condition 6: Absence of preventers (mawāniʿ)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cacc0eb5-1dea-498f-add6-8fcdf9dacd4d
:END:
- there must be *no preventers* of takfīr present.
  - even if there is a great scholar says so and so is a kafir
    - they can be correct and incorrect
      - hence you don't hold his worlds like the qur'an  
        - you can go against the ijtihad of a scholar, it is not binding upon you
          - since there could have been a preventer and there ijtihad could have been wrong
**** what is not a preventer
***** Joking/mocking
    - if they joke then it mean that the min level of eman is not there, hence it's not a prevent of takfir    
***** Holding onto you're worldly posistion/status
***** Practising the pilars are not prevented of takfir
- e.g the people who joke about the Prophet (ﷺ) and did jihad with the prophet (ﷺ)
      
**** there are 4 main preventers

** Mistakes of takfīr

*** Qāʿidah
#+begin_quote
Whoever /does not/ make takfīr of a disbeliever is himself a disbeliever.
#+end_quote

*** Who this *does* refer to (included)
- Everyone who is *not* attributed to Islām:
  - e.g. if someone says that the Jews, Christians, Buddhists and others will go to Jannah
    - then they are a kāfir, because Allah has called them kuffār
      - so for you to call them believers is as if you are saying Allah is lying in the Qur’ān.
  - people like the Qādiyānī (Ahmadi) sect.

*** Who this *does not* refer to (excluded)
- Matters where the ‘ulamā’ differ:
  - e.g. the one who leaves the ṣalāh (is he a kāfir or a fāsiq?).
- Anyone who believes that the *conditions* of takfīr are *not* fulfilled on a specific person:
  - i.e. the person could have been ignorant.
  - takfīr on a matter that is not clear, or which could have more than one possible meaning.

**** Example: ambiguous statements
- e.g. someone says: “the people of beards are criminals”
  - it could mean the anbiyā’ who had beards (if taken literally),
  - or it could mean a specific group of criminals who happen to have beards.
- Hence, if a statement reasonably has more than one possible meaning, we do *not* rush to takfīr.

**** Takfīr based on what a statement *necessitates*
- Example:
  - some people say: “Allah has inner speech and then Jibrīl translated it,”
    - this would *seem* to necessitate that:
      - Jibrīl’s ‘translation’ created the Qur’ān — its letters and words in Arabic —
      - and hence the Qur’ān would be *created*.
    - the Salaf said: “whoever says the Qur’ān is created is a kāfir.”
  - But:
    - if a person says “the Qur’ān is the inner speech of Allah,”
      - we do *not* automatically know that he means “the Qur’ān is created.”
    - so it is a mistake to make takfīr based on what a person’s words *might* necessitate.
      - it is like forcing someone to say something they did not explicitly say.
      - if this is what the statement logically necessitates:
        - it proves that the person’s statement is *contradictory*,
        - we use his contradictory statements to refute his belief,
          - but not to make takfīr of him.

- The correct belief:
  - Allah speaks whenever He wills and His speech can be heard.
    - e.g. Allah spoke to Mūsā (عليه السلام).

*** Takfīr as ijtihād, not a core point of ʿaqīdah
- Takfīr is a *matter of ijtihād*, not a fundamental point of ʿaqīdah.
  - it is for the mujtahid and the fuqahā’ to deal with.
- Hence:
  - if someone does not align with a *particular* application of takfīr,
    - it is not the same as differing in a core matter of ʿaqīdah.
      - because if their ʿaqīdah itself was corrupt, they would not be “from us.”
- For a statement to contradict the ʿaqīdah:
  - it means the *belief* itself is corrupt,
  - not merely that someone’s *ijtihād* in takfīr is different.

*** Takfīr related to major sins

**** Major sins vs disbelief
- That which has *not* reached the boundary of disbelief:
  - you cannot make takfīr of someone *just* for a major sin.
**** Meaning of “major sin”
- A *major sin* includes:
  1. that which has a capital punishment in this world:
     - theft,
     - zinā,
  2. or its punishment is explicitly mentioned in the Hereafter:
     - consuming the wealth of the orphan,
  3. or whoever does this action is *cursed*:
     - e.g. those who do tattoos and those who pluck their eyebrows,
       - the meaning of “curse” is being pushed away from the mercy of Allah.
  4. or the anger of Allah is upon him:
     - e.g. killing a believer intentionally.
  5. or īmān has been negated for the person:
     - e.g. the one whose neighbour is not safe from his harm.
  6. or it is “this person is not from us,”
     - or the Prophet (ﷺ) said he is free from such a person,
       - e.g. the one who slaps the cheeks and wails (at a calamity).

- A major sin:
  - *requires* a specific expiation (tawbah, ḥadd, etc.).
- Minor sins:
  - can be expiated with good deeds.

**** Proximity of major sins to kufr
- The more severe the sin, the closer it is to the boundary of disbelief.

- Ḥadīth:
  - “The fornicator is not a believer *while* he is committing fornication…”
    - he drops from the level of *mu’min* to the basic level of *Muslim* while in that state.
    - he can rise back up to the level of *mu’min* by:
      - seeking repentance,
      - even seeking the prescribed punishment (ḥadd),
        - e.g. ḥadīth of Mā‘iz,
      - entering the Fire of Jahannam if he was not forgiven before:
        - he will *not* remain there forever if two conditions are met:
          1. he is from the people of tawḥīd,
          2. he did *not* declare the sin ḥalāl (did not legalise it).

- They will be under the Will of Allah:
  - there will be a group of people who committed major sins;
    - Allah may forgive them even if they did not make explicit repentance.

- Hence, it is important to distinguish between:
  - *major sin* and
  - *disbelief (/kufr/)*.
   

* TODO 1. Shirk in the worship of Allah
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d7a98ea4-1cb6-4d21-925b-ea8da8034fc1
:END:
/Shirk/ (associating partners) in the worship of Allah.

Allah says:
#+begin_quote
“Verily, Allah /does not forgive/ that partners be associated with Him in worship (i.e. Shirk), but He _forgives what is less_ than that to whom He wills.”  
[Surah an‑Nisaa 4:48]
#+end_quote

And He says:
#+begin_quote
“Verily, the one who /mixes partners/ in worship with Allah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made /forbidden/ for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).”  
[Surah al‑Maa’idah 5:72]
#+end_quote

- What falls into this is /performing sacrifices/ to someone other than Allah,
  - such as the person who offers a sacrifice to the jinn or to a grave.
    
** Agreed-upon nullifiers of Islām
*** Statement of al-Mardāwī in *al-Inṣāf*
- Al-Madawī (al-Mardāwī), in *Kitāb al-Inṣāf*, said:
  - whoever commits shirk with Allah,
    - or denies His Lordship, or His Oneness, or His attributes,
    - or takes for Allah a companion,
    - or denies a prophet, a book, or anything from it,
    - or insults Allah or His Messenger (ﷺ),
  - then he is a kāfir, and this is agreed upon.
  - what is intended is someone who does this *willingly*,
    - even if he says it while “joking”.

** Assisting shirk and establishing it on earth

*** Statement of Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ
- Assisting people in committing shirk and allowing it to be established on earth:
  - Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ said:
    - we make takfīr regarding every action that the Muslims agree is kufr
      - even if the doer is (outwardly) a Muslim.

**** Clear examples
- like a man bowing down to an idol:
  - this posture and prostration that he does for the idol is shirk,
    - this is what the mushrikūn do for their idols.
- to wear the special garment that differentiates them:
  - e.g. the belt (/zunnār/) that Abū Bakr made the kuffār wear,
  - these actions are signs of disbelief.

** Imitating shirk-specific symbols

- Shirk is a nullifier – and imitating it (in what is specific to it) is also a nullifier.
- Imitating that which is *exclusive* to the practice of shirk:
  - a clear symbol of their religion,
  - not the general customs of the people.

** Intending disbelief

- To *intend* disbelief is itself disbelief.
  - e.g. intending to construct a church (as a place of kufr and shirk) with that intention.

* 2. Taking intermediaries between oneself and Allah
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ee07fb2a-c6cd-4ae7-8eea-f9e6296fe50f
:END:
Whoever places /intermediaries/ between himself and Allah
- /calling/ upon them,
  - asking them for /intercession/, and
    - placing /reliance/ upon them,
- has committed disbelief, according to the unanimous agreement (ijmā‘).

** Why people take intermediaries
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0ad5bd58-349b-4884-a615-6cb1ed54d220
:END:
- because they believe they are too sinful to call upon Allah directly
- they think:
  - “I am not worthy to ask Allah, so I will ask a righteous dead person to bring me closer.”

- you can ask a person who is *alive* (to make du‘ā’ for you),
  - but not someone who is *dead*, because they cannot hear what you ask.

- they liken Allah to the kings of the earth:
  - thinking that, just as you cannot approach a king directly but must go through his close servants,
  - likewise they cannot ask Allah directly, so they go to the creation (like a righteous dead person).

** The correct way: du‘ā’ directly to Allah
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4fe3022c-ad9b-48cd-843b-81df25532879
:END:
- We should ask Allah directly,
  - because Allah tells you to call upon Him.
- du‘ā’ is worship.

** Permissible types of tawassul (seeking a means)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c88fadc2-7dd5-49de-af56-6f51eef82878
:END:

Allah says (paraphrased): “Have taqwā of Allah and seek the means (wasīlah) to Him.”

*** Taqwā – what it means
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       13cff8d6-d6ef-4699-9dfd-487936ab6117
:END:
- to worship Allah through His commands and stay away from His prohibitions according to the Qur’ān and Sunnah
- to make a barrier between you and the punishment of Allah
  - hence, by following the Qur’ān and Sunnah you build a “barrier” around yourself from the punishment of Allah

*** Seeking the means – what is allowed
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9a69fdd3-b9c7-46b9-aaaa-d942223e4b7f

- calling upon Allah by His Names and Attributes (recommended)
  - e.g. “O Most Merciful, have mercy on me…”

- mentioning your own good deeds (permissible)
  - e.g. “O Allah, I ask You by the qiyām al-layl that I have prayed…”

  - what is *not* permissible:
    - to ask by *someone else’s* good deeds:
      - “O Allah, I ask you by the deeds of so-and-so…”
      - this is an innovation / impermissible.

- asking a *living* person to make du‘ā’ for you (permissible, and sometimes recommended)

    - he is *alive*
    - he is *present* (or aware of the request, e.g. you speak to him or message him)
    - he is *able* to make du‘ā’.
   
* 3. Not declaring the polytheists to be disbelievers

Whoever does not:
- hold the /polytheists/ to be disbelievers,
- or has /doubts/ about their disbelief,
- or considers their way and beliefs to be /correct/,
- has committed disbelief.

** Two main categories of people
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       dce6fbad-11b5-4ed4-a69d-b2eb222f1a16
:END:

*** 1. Al-kāfir al-aṣlī (original disbeliever)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7f0a81b4-086c-49a2-8d81-902486903fd0
:END:
- e.g. the Jews, Christians and others.
- He is *originally* a kāfir (never entered Islām).
- It is /farḍ/ for every Muslim to believe that he is a kāfir.
  - if someone does *not* believe this, then he himself is a disbeliever.
- “Indeed, Islām is the only accepted religion.”

*** 2. Al-murtadd (apostate)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       243e717e-449e-414b-bc2d-050869a250f4
:END:
- not originally a kāfir; he had entered Islām, then left it.

**** Types of apostates
1. One who willingly leaves Islām and openly claims he has left Islām.
   - this nullifier applies to him.
   - it is /farḍ/ for every Muslim to believe he is a kāfir;
     - if someone does *not* believe this, he is a disbeliever.

2. One who commits an act of disbelief that the scholars have /agreed upon/ as kufr,
   and have agreed that he becomes a kāfir by it, regardless of what he claims.
   - again:
     - it is /farḍ/ for every Muslim to believe he is a kāfir;
       - if someone does *not* believe this, he is a disbeliever.

3. One who has fallen into an act of disbelief about which the scholars /differ/:
   - “has he left Islām or not?”
   - this third nullifier is *not* applied to this category,
     - because the matter itself is disputed.

** Fitnah of our times: “Abrahamic faith” unification
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a466fee8-fe01-4815-9426-8ea8e7d88505
:END:

- The modern trial of calling to “unifying the Abrahamic faiths”:
  - i.e. “follow the religion of Ibrāhīm; why are we being harsh with our other ‘Abrahamic brothers’?”
  - they claim:
    - all of them will be accepted,
    - they call it “the religion of the sky” or “Abrahamic family of religions”.
  - This project has been promoted for political gain (e.g. in the UAE).

- This falls under the third nullifier:
  - approving the religion and path of the disbelievers.

- Netanyahu called this the “Abrahamic alliance”:
  - to water down and dismantle Islām,
  - to destroy the foundations of Islām,
  - because if Christians and Jews are accepted “as they are”, then:
    - there is no longer a need for da‘wah to Islām.

** Islām abrogates previous religions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cc21cf05-eaba-423e-8183-80e6b3489ad1
:END:

- Allah has abrogated every religion that came before Islām.
  - Islām has removed their previous legitimacy.
- Allah did not send the Prophet (ﷺ) only to the Arabs,
  - but to *all* of mankind:
    - as a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.

- The Prophet (ﷺ) warned the Jews and Christians:
  - Allah called them disbelievers,
  - and described some of them as the worst of creation.
    - they took their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allah.
    - Allah negates īmān from them in many āyāt.
    - they mock Allah.
    - their scriptures have been changed, depicting Allah and the messengers with errors and deficiencies.
      - the Jews and Christians are from the polytheists when they commit such beliefs.

- Allah has made certain forms of close alliance with them (in ‘aqīdah and wala’/barā’) as disbelief:
  - we cannot inherit from them,
  - and they cannot inherit from us.

- Those nations *other than* the People of the Book:
  - their warning is even more severe, since they had no revelation or guidance in the first place.

- Ḥadīth:
  - if Mūsā or ‘Īsā (عليهما السلام) were alive in the time of the Prophet (ﷺ),
    - they would have followed the Prophet (ﷺ).

- It is permissible to read their books *in order to refute them*.

- Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ and Imām al-Nawawī:
  - both stated that there is consensus that they (Jews, Christians etc., after the coming of the Prophet ﷺ) are kuffār.

*** Misusing: “For you your religion, and for me mine”
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6fafd862-4232-4f60-b6eb-5b3c66f42bee
:END:
- They say:
  - “for you is your religion and for me is mine” means:
    - “you can have whatever religion you want; all are fine.”
- This understanding is wrong.
  - In context, it is a *disassociation* from shirk:
    - “for you is *your shirk* and for us is *our tawḥīd*.”
  - This is known in Arabic usage:
    - “You are free from what I do, and I am free from what you do.”
    - It is a *threat and a warning*, not approval.

*** Misusing the claim to Ibrāhīm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c4da9564-138a-47ce-b6ff-be6c2eca44f0
:END:
- They try to tie themselves to Ibrāhīm (عليه السلام):
  - but Allah says he was:
    - not a Jew,
    - not a Christian,
    - and *not* a polytheist.
  - he was a ḥanīf and a Muslim.
  - Allah frees him from their shirk.

- Therefore:
  - to approve their present-day religions is *not permissible*.
  - Ibrāhīm (عليه السلام) is *free* from them and their distorted beliefs.

*** “People of the Book” – who are they?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       08f4b17c-f3aa-43f0-b046-5b3426c10c6f
:END:
- They are not the same as those who presently cling to altered Judaism and Christianity.
- “People of the Book” who are praised:
  - are those from the People of the Book who *became Muslim*,
  - and those who followed the prophets *before* their religions were abrogated.

- After the sending of Muḥammad (ﷺ):
  - all are commanded to follow him,
  - and whoever does not is not upon the true dīn of Ibrāhīm.

* 4. Believing in guidance or judgement better than that of the Prophet ﷺ
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a19f7492-e544-4e68-8cae-fea74d8e0bb1
:END:
Whoever believes that some guidance /other than that/ of the Prophet (ﷺ) is more complete/greater than his guidance,
- or that someone else’s judgement is /better/ than his judgement
- such as the one who prefers the judgement of the [[id:c0f374b3-f05a-49ab-9725-98b8547fdd9f][tāghūt]] (false authorities and systems) over his judgement
- then he is a disbeliever.

** Exclusive right of Allah to legislate (tashrīʿ)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b9ec982e-e086-473e-be1e-5e6e0102baa9
:END:
- To *legislate laws* (declare things ḥalāl and ḥarām) is the *exclusive right of Allah*.
- Only Allah can:
  - make something *ḥalāl*,
  - make something *ḥarām*.
- Whoever:
  - gives this right to other than Allah, or
  - goes against Allah’s legislation knowingly and deliberately,
  - has made rivals (and partners) with Allah in *tashrīʿ*.
- This is a type of disbelief:
  - rejecting Allah’s ḥukm,
  - denying His sole right to legislate.

** Ruling on preferring man-made law over Sharīʿah
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0b7e578b-b4d7-44d4-9e1f-2e7f3bab4db2
:END:
- Whoever *rejects* the laws of Allah and:
  - holds that *other* laws are *greater*,
  - or *equal*,
  - or says: “They are not greater, but we can govern by them instead,”
  - or upholds a constitution in *opposition* to the Sharīʿah,
- then he has disbelieved (kufr akbar) according to the statements of many scholars.
- The Sharīʿah of Muḥammad (ﷺ):
  - is for *all times and places*,
  - is the most perfect, just and complete guidance.
- The enemies of Islām try to dismantle the religion at its foundation by:
  - replacing the Sharīʿah with man-made systems,
  - weakening belief in its completeness,
  - promoting projects like:
    - so-called “Abrahamic unity,”
    - secularism,
    - liberalism,
    - and other ideologies that separate life from Allah’s law.

*** Basic idea
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9c705dc5-36a9-4cbc-9522-0222a22bd646
:END:
- Secularism = separating *religion from state* and public life.
- The secularist says:
  - “If you want to worship Allah, do it in your *house* or *mosque*.”
  - “Do *not* implement Islām in public, law, economics, politics, education, etc.”
- This idea is kufr in its *foundation* because:
  - Islām requires that Allah be worshipped and obeyed in *all* aspects of life.
  - The only accepted religion with Allah is *complete submission* to Him, inwardly and outwardly.
  - “Fight them until there is no shirk and the religion is all for Allah.” (i.e. His sole right to be obeyed and worshipped.)

*** Example from the people of Shuʿayb (عليه السلام)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b18908b6-7454-4228-a4d1-05d1f00793e0
:END:
- The people of Shuʿayb deceived people in their *worldly dealings* (cheating in measure and weight).
- When he corrected them and called them to obey Allah in business, they replied (meaning):
  - “What does your *prayer* have to do with our *wealth* and our *business*?”
- Their objection:
  - “What does your religion have to do with our money?”
  - This is the *same core* as secularism:
    - separating dīn from worldly dealings,
    - refusing to let revelation govern commerce and public life.

*** Secularism vs fundamentals of Islām
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       de560774-da50-4326-89e6-099442aeb9ac
:END:
- The entire concept of secularism:
  - opposes the *core fundamentals* of Islām,
  - which include:
    - submitting to Allah in *all* matters,
    - including worldly dealings, politics, economics and law.
- The believer is commanded:
  - “Enter into Islām *completely*,”
  - not just inside homes and mosques.

*** Colonial strategy
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       99bf3a51-43fe-48bb-bc53-9bd8c9a82e8a
:END:
- Colonisers entered Muslim lands and:
  - imposed their *control* over land and resources,
  - attacked the *Arabic* and Islamic languages and cultures,
  - tried to erase Islamic identity.
- They sought to:
  - change the *language* and *culture*,
  - change the *education system*,
  - convince people:
    - “The Islamic system is not suitable for our time.”
- Step by step they:
  - limited or removed the *Sharīʿah* from public life,
  - inserted *man-made laws* in its place,
  - until there was *no Sharīʿah system* to go back to in courts and constitutions.
- Consequence:
  - oppression spread in the land,
  - because shirk is oppression,
  - they took the ḥaqq of Allah in legislation,
  - and tried to destroy the religion from its *foundation*.

*** False “Islamic” labels
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3ce9edef-ae39-42a5-b2b9-0eca080ea773
:END:
- In many places:
  - a man-made system is presented to the people as if it is *Sharīʿah*,
  - but in reality it is secular or mixed law.
- Muslims then:
  - look to Western lands, see worldly peace and prosperity,
  - compare it with their own corrupt, unjust systems (which are *not* true Sharīʿah),
  - and then blame *Islām* itself.
- In reality:
  - the coloniser’s system is what is being applied,
  - but it is given a “Sharīʿah” label to confuse the people.

*** Legalising what Allah has forbidden
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       13bf1b7b-484d-4de1-9824-36b1081050fb
:END:
- They *legalise* what Allah has made ḥarām:
  - interest (ribā),
  - zina,
  - many forms of immorality and corruption.
- They *criticise* capital punishments (ḥudūd) in Islām:
  - they call it barbaric and outdated,
  - they deny that there is any wisdom or mercy in it,
  - they remove a means by which sins are *deterrent* in this world,
  - and by which the sinner may have his sin *expiated*.

*** Fatāwā on ruling by other than Allah’s law
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e035a725-1d04-42ce-853a-4a42eba183df
:END:
- Contemporary scholars and muftis have issued fatāwā that:
  - ruling by laws that *replace*, *oppose* or *prefer* other legislation over the Sharīʿah,
  - out of belief in their superiority or suitability,
  - falls into kufr akbar.
- They distinguish between:
  - *rejecting/changing the law itself* (kufr in belief),
  - vs. *committing injustice* in applying it in some cases (major sin).

** Liberalism
:PROPERTIES:

*** Core liberal slogan & double standards
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1ec84daa-9fdd-465c-88b8-39270e1cb9f4
:END:
- Liberalism calls to:
  - “Everything is ok as long as you are not harming someone else.”
  - or: “Do whatever you want, as long as you do not harm others.”
- So:
  - almost anything is tolerated,
  - *until* the choice is clearly Islamic:
    - e.g. a woman covering her face in France,
    - or a Muslim community wishing to apply Islamic capital punishments.
- When the choice is based on Islām:
  - suddenly, it is “not permissible,”
  - they will ban it or punish those who practice it,
  - such Muslims are demonised and tarnished in the media.
- This shows:
  - their “freedom” is selective,
  - the real problem is with Islām itself, not with “harm”.

*** Accountability vs claim of “absolute freedom”
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       318ca578-66ea-48d4-b1d8-afddb08b4469
:END:
- In Islām:
  - a human being does *not* have the right to do whatever he wants.
- If he truly had such a right:
  - there would be no *accountability* for actions,
  - no Day of Judgement,
  - no concept of ḥalāl and ḥarām.
- The believer knows:
  - he will be held to account for *every* action,
  - so he cannot accept the secular‑liberal claim of absolute personal freedom.

*** Not applying a ruling vs changing the law
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cae73038-87c7-47be-bf8e-7213adec3942
:END:
- Example:
  - If a person does *not* rule with the prescribed punishment (e.g. death for a muḥṣan who commits zinā) for someone he *loves*:
    - he has done something sinful and unjust,
    - but this does *not* necessarily mean he has *changed the law* in belief.
- Many people fail to distinguish between:
  - a *single, isolated failure* to apply a law (due to weakness, bias, bribery, etc.),
  - and *abolishing the law* or replacing it.
- If a ruler:
  - never implements the punishment at all,
  - effectively abolishes it,
  - or replaces it with his own system and believes that is better,
  - then this resembles *changing the legislation* itself.
- People’s confusion here leads to:
  - mistakes in takfīr,
  - mixing up major kufr with lesser sins and injustices.

*** True freedom in Islām
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       059a2ec1-53c2-4399-928f-93e321b06bec
:END:
- True freedom:
  - is that which is in line with the Sharīʿah.
- A servant is:
  - never free from obedience,
  - he either obeys his desires and shayṭān,
  - or he obeys Allah alone and is freed from every other form of slavery.

*** Foundation of liberalism:

**** materialism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9ffd9f09-09aa-4da3-9113-6ca4682903fa
:END:
- The foundation of liberalism is:
  - *materialism* – making the purpose of life:
    - acquiring the worldly life,
    - increasing material possessions and pleasures,
    - treating what is *tangible* as more important than spiritual benefit.
- This is similar to how Shayṭān removed Ādam from Jannah:
  - he focused him on a *tree* and worldly benefit,
  - made the tree appear more appealing than Allah’s command,
  - supported this with:
    - oaths,
    - false “evidence,”
    - constant reminders,
    - pretending care and concern for their “good,”
  - while in reality it was pure evil.
- This same pattern:
  - is used by the enemies of the Muslims today:
    - beautifying the dunyā,
    - decorating their systems and lifestyle,
    - detaching hearts from the *Ākhirah*,
    - making people chase and compete in worldly life,
    - so that they forget the purpose of creation and obedience to Allah.

**** Freedom
- “Does the human being think he will be left without purpose?”
- In Islām:
  - we return back to the *text* (Qurʾān and Sunnah).
  - The sound mind will never conflict with a sound text.
  - We use logical arguments that are *based* on the Qurʾān and Sunnah.
- Establishing the oneness of Allah (tawḥīd) means:
  - establishing the *laws* of Allah which prevent that which is harmful,
  - recognising that comfort cannot be attained without the remembrance of Allah,
  - knowing that the *good* in what He commanded outweighs any harm.
- What He prohibits:
  - is either completely harmful,
  - or its harm outweighs any benefit.
- The rulings of Sharīʿah:
  - revolve around the *majority* outcome (overall benefit),
  - with specific rulings for minority or special cases.
  - They focus on the rights of Allah and the rights of the creation.
- Sharīʿah deters people from ḥarām:
  - by making them conscious that Allah always sees them,
    - in public and in private.
- There is more ḥalāl on the earth than ḥarām:
  - the default ruling for things is *ḥalāl*, not ḥarām.
  - The problem in living in the lands of the kuffār:
    - we are exposed to many ḥarām things,
    - so it feels like “everything” is ḥarām.
  - In reality:
    - even in the supermarket, most things are ḥalāl,
    - only a few items are ḥarām.
- This religion is easy and life has been made easy:
  - for everything that is ḥarām, there is a ḥalāl alternative.
  - This is a type of freedom that protects you and protects society.
- The Sharīʿah came to protect *five* things:
  - *Religion*:
    - the greatest objective,
    - protected through ḥadd punishments and other laws.
  - *Life*:
    - e.g. blood money and retribution (qiṣāṣ).
  - *Wealth*:
    - e.g. cutting the hand of the thief.
  - *Honour and lineage*:
    - e.g. 80 lashes for accusing someone of zinā.
  - *Intellect*:
    - by prohibiting intoxicants and anything that corrupts the mind.
- In liberalism:
  - they return back to the *ʿaql* alone,
  - seek comfort and avoid being touched by harm,
  - do not focus on the rights of Allah,
  - focus mainly on the individual and “not harming others”.
  - They deter people by law alone, not by īmān and fear of Allah.
- Many contradictions appear in their laws from following desires:
  - e.g. homosexuality:
    - previously criminalised or pathologised,
    - later legalised and celebrated,
    - showing the law changes with desire, not with fixed truth.

**** Equality
- The Sharīʿah of Allah is not based upon *equality* but upon *justice*.
  - If equality is justice, the Sharīʿah calls to it.
  - If equality is injustice, the Sharīʿah opposes it.
- Allah commands with *justice*, not blind equality.
- Allah loves those who are *just*.
- A man is different to a woman, and a woman is different to a man.
- The default position:
  - men and women are the same in:
    - reward,
    - punishment,
    - accountability before Allah.
  - Then there are differences based on *evidence*.
    - e.g. a woman is excused from ṣalāh during menses, a man is not.
    - a man must go out to fight, a woman is not obliged to.
- Old and young:
  - the older have a higher priority than the younger,
  - you should let someone older pass through the door before you.
- The Sharīʿah does not take the feelings of people if it goes against justice.
- When liberals call to “equality”, they mean:
  - equality in *everything*,
  - regardless of mind, ability and capacity.

- Feminism is built upon *kufr*.
  - If it is about fair *rights* between the two, then the Sharīʿah agrees and already established those rights.
  - But if they say:
    - men should be like women and women should be like men (in everything),
    - this goes against the Sharīʿah.
      - It is a “freedom” that goes against the Sharīʿah, not for the Sharīʿah.
  - A man has his role and the woman has her role.
    - Each has rights between them,
    - and each can take the other to the qāḍī if their rights are violated.

  - They bring doubts, such as:

    - **Testimony of 2 women = 1 man**
      - Men engage more in society and public dealings.
      - The same principle is applied to the Bedouin:
        - the testimony of the Bedouin is not taken over the one who lives in the city in some matters.
      - A man has to work outside and spend time with people and dealings.
        - This does *not* mean women are deficient,
        - but that they spend less time in these specific dealings.
      - If there are two women:
        - they can remind each other,
        - as also mentioned in the Qurʾān.
      - Regarding “today”:
        - we say the Sharīʿah is for all times and places,
        - and has laws for *general* humans,
        - not built on specific cases and situations.

    - **Blood money of a man 100 vs 50 (same logic for inheritance)**
      - A man and woman are both worth more than 100 camels.
      - If someone were to lose both hands and both feet:
        - the compensation would be *more* than the diyyah.
        - This shows it is not based on the value of the person.
      - If 10 men got together to kill a girl:
        - all 10 men would be killed in the Sharīʿah.
        - This shows it is not based on the value of the person:
          - here, one girl equals 10 men in qiṣāṣ.
      - So there is another reason:
        - the man is the provider and breadwinner of the family,
        - and provides for them.
      - The reason for higher diyyah:
        - is to help with the financial difficulties when the man dies,
        - to make up for the loss of the main provider.
        - The woman should always be taken care of.
      - The man has a greater financial burden than the woman:
        - a woman can spend on whatever she wants,
        - a man must spend on his womenfolk and other financial responsibilities as an *obligation*.

    - **Ḥijāb**
      - They ask: why doesn’t a man have to wear ḥijāb while a woman does?
      - A man has a different desire than a woman.
        - The way the man’s desire is triggered is different.
      - Hence:
        - it is prohibited for a woman to adorn herself in front of non‑maḥram men,
        - to wear anklets that make noise,
        - to beautify her voice for men.
      - The Sharīʿah is just and serves both:
        - this is the only practical way to protect both sides.

    - **Roles of men and women**
      - From the role of men:
        - he is responsible for the woman and must take care of her.
      - From the role of women:
        - she should take care of the household,
        - raise the children with the correct foundation.
      - They both work hand in hand.
        - They are not the same in their mercy
        - and in what they can bear for the child.
      - Some of the scholars derived:
        - that men are more “uni‑modal” minded,
        - and women are more “multi‑modal” minded.
        - From this they say:
          - in testimony:
            - a man can focus on one thing with all his attention,
            - a woman may be dealing with multiple things at once,
            - so two women can remind each other if one forgets.

    - **Leadership**
      - The Prophet (ﷺ) said that a nation will not be successful if a woman is in charge.
      - They ask: how was the Queen of Sheba successful?
        - Their success was limited and in dunyā,
        - and they were worshippers of the sun, so there is no real success.
        - True success only came when she joined with Sulaymān (عليه السلام).

    - **Emotions and divorce**
      - Women are more emotional in general due to physiological changes such as menses.
      - Hence:
        - she does not hold the same ṭalāq authority as the man,
        - but she *can* still get divorced:
          - via khulʿ,
          - or by going to the qāḍī for annulment.

    - **Polygyny**
      - A man can marry more than one woman, but a woman cannot marry more than one man.
      - The protective jealousy (ghayrah) of a man is greater.
      - If a woman has multiple husbands:
        - then lineage cannot be established,
        - this leads to illnesses and STDs,
        - and the child’s rights are lost – it becomes oppressive to the child.
      - From the man’s side:
        - he can have multiple children,
        - marry women who cannot have children so they are not left alone,
        - and provide for them.

**** Self Importance
- “Do what benefits *you*, seek what *you* want”:
  - this is a main foundation of liberalism.
- The Sharīʿah completely opposes this idea:
  - “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”
  - They (the righteous) prefer others over themselves even if they are hungry.
- All the wealthy must take care of the poor:
  - and in case they “forget”, Allah has made it *obligatory* through:
    - zakāh,
    - and many expiations in the Sharīʿah:
      - free a slave,
      - or feed people, etc.
- The Sharīʿah is here to protect *everyone*:
  - not just oneself,
  - but the whole society,
  - while giving Allah’s right the highest place.
 
** Causes of Muslims falling into these problems
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c07be03e-fed6-4f67-b95d-917b1032921d
:END:
- Not learning the *fitan* (trials) of their times.
- Not knowing the *value* and perfection of Islām.
- Imitating the disbelievers in:
  - dress,
  - customs,
  - celebrations,
  - ways of thinking.
- Living amongst them without knowledge, īmān and grounding.
- Developing an *inferiority complex*:
  - feeling ashamed of Islām,
  - thinking non-Muslim civilisation is superior in every way.

** Importance of visible Muslim identity
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e367f149-eefc-4872-b6d0-f819caeee1a5
:END:
- It is strongly encouraged for a man to:
  - have a clear *Muslim identity* in his appearance and behaviour,
  - to stand out as a person of Islām, not dissolved into the crowd.
- This supports the Muslim women:
  - who are wearing ḥijāb and outward signs of Islām,
  - and shows that the men of the Ummah are also visibly upon their dīn.
- Enemies of Islām:
  - often focus on women’s ḥijāb and symbols of Islām,
  - but they know that if Muslim men respond strongly and collectively,
    - it would instil *fear* in the hearts of the disbelievers,
    - and strengthen the morale of the Muslims.
      
* 5. Hating anything that the Messenger ﷺ came with

Whoever /hates/ something that the Messenger (ﷺ) came with – even if he acts upon it – has disbelieved.

** Loving Allah = loving His legislation
- Loving Allah includes:
  - loving *His legislation* (Sharīʿah),
  - loving the *rulings* that Allah has given.
- We believe:
  - these rulings are the *best* thing for mankind,
  - the Sharīʿah is *perfect*.
- It is *obligatory* to love:
  - every aspect of what the Messenger (ﷺ) came with.
- There is:
  - *no harm* if a person dislikes the *hardship* or *difficulty* they *face* when doing an act,
  - as long as they still *love* the ruling itself and submit to it.

** Disliking the hardship vs hating the Sharīʿah

- Example: jihād
  - Allah says:

#+begin_quote
“Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it.  
Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you.  
Allah knows and you do not know.”  
[al‑Baqarah 2:216]
#+end_quote

  - A believer may:
    - dislike the *hardship* and fear that come with fighting,
    - but still *love* the ruling and accept that it is from Allah.

- Example: wuḍū’ in hardship  
  - It was narrated from Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:

#+begin_quote
“Shall I not tell you of that by means of which Allah erases sins and raises (people) in status?  
Doing wuḍū’ properly even when it is inconvenient,  
taking many steps to the Masjid,  
and waiting for one Ṣalāh after another.  
That is the ribāṭ for you, that is the ribāṭ for you, that is the ribāṭ for you.”  
[an‑Nasā’ī, 143]
https://sunnah.com/nasai:143
#+end_quote

  - The cold water or inconvenience may be disliked,
  - but the *act* and the *ruling* are loved.

- Example: Jannah surrounded by disliked things  
  - Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported:
#+begin_quote
“The (Hell) Fire is surrounded with all kinds of desires and passions,  
while Jannah is surrounded with adversities.”  
[al‑Bukhārī and Muslim]
https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:101
#+end_quote

  - The *hardship* in doing good deeds is often disliked by the nafs,
  - but the believer *loves* what leads to Jannah and *hates* what leads to Hell.

- Important distinction:
  - The hardship or pain in the *action* can be disliked.
  - But:
    - if someone starts to dislike the *Sharīʿah itself*,
    - or question its wisdom from a worldly mindset,
    - this becomes dangerous and can fall into *hating* what the Messenger (ﷺ) came with.

** Foundation of īmān
- Loving what the Messenger (ﷺ) came with:
  - is a *foundation* of īmān.
- To *hate* any part of it in one’s heart:
  - destroys the deeds.
- What destroys the deeds at the root is *kufr*.
- The Sharīʿah:
  - is what *pleases* Allah.
- Therefore:
  - hating a ruling, symbol, or aspect of the dīn *as a ruling* from Allah and His Messenger,
  - contradicts īmān and falls under this nullifier.

** Connection to al‑walā’ wal‑barā’
- This principle goes back to:
  - *al‑walā’ wal‑barā’*:
    - loving and being loyal for Allah’s sake,
    - hating and disavowing for Allah’s sake.
- Part of īmān is:
  - hating whatever *opposes* the Sharīʿah,
  - and loving everything that *agrees* with it.

- Link:
  - [[id:874b8b0d-7182-4032-80f7-2195b1e27a6a][loving and hating for Allah]]

- The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

#+begin_quote
“If anyone loves for Allah’s sake,  
hates for Allah’s sake,  
gives for Allah’s sake  
and withholds for Allah’s sake,  
he will have perfect faith.”
#+end_quote

- So:
  - loving what the Messenger (ﷺ) came with,
  - and hating what contradicts it,
  - is from *complete and perfect* īmān.
  - Hating the dīn itself, even while outwardly doing it, is what nullifies īmān.

* 6. Mocking any part of the religion

** Text of the nullifier
Whoever *mocks or ridicules* anything from the religion of the Messenger (ﷺ),  
or its *rewards* or its *punishments*, has committed *disbelief* (kufr).

** Proof
#+begin_quote
“Say, ‘Was it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?  
Make no excuses. You have disbelieved after having had faith.’”  
[at‑Tawbah 9:65‑66]
#+end_quote

** Story: Battle of Tabūk
- When the Prophet (ﷺ) was returning from the expedition of Tabūk:
  - There was a group of people who were joking about the Prophet (ﷺ) and his noble Companions.
  - They said things like:
    - “They only want to fill their stomachs,”
    - calling them liars,
    - and calling them cowards.
- The Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions are free from this slander.

- One of the men in the group said:
  - “You are lying,” to the others, and went to inform the Prophet (ﷺ).
- When they were confronted, they said:
  - “We did not intend disbelief – we were only joking and playing.”

- Then the verse was revealed:
  - “Was it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?  
    Make no excuses. You have disbelieved after having had faith.”

- Note:
  - It was *one man* who spoke, but the ruling “you have disbelieved” applied to *all* of them.
  - Their *silence* was a form of *tacit approval* (iqrār sukūtī).

** Ruling: Being present where the dīn is mocked
- If you are in a gathering where:
  - Allah is mocked,
  - or His Messenger (ﷺ) is mocked,
  - or His laws are mocked,
  - or anything from the religion is mocked,

- You have two options:
  1. **Rebuke and defend** the dīn.
  2. **Leave** the gathering.

- If you cannot do either:
  - then you *must* hate it in your heart.
  - This is the *lowest level* of īmān.

- The religion of Allah is a *red line*.

** What counts as “mocking” (istihzā’)
- The boundary of “mocking”:
  - is based on what the *custom of the people* (‘urf) considers to be an insult.
- A person does *not* have to know that:
  - “this action is an act of disbelief”
  - in order to *become* a kāfir by it.

- Allah said about them:
  - “You have disbelieved after having had faith.”
- Ibn Taymiyyah (رحمه الله) said:
  - This shows they *thought* they had not done an act of disbelief.
  - It only requires the *minimum level* of īmān to *avoid* mocking Allah, His verses and His Messenger.
  - So if someone does this, it shows:
    - he does not even have that *minimum* level of īmān.

** Mocking what is maʿlūm min ad-dīn bi-d-darūrah
- If a person:
  - jokes about or makes fun of something that is *known by necessity* to be from Islām  
    (معلوم من الدين بالضرورة),
  - then he is a *kāfir*.

- If he mocks something *not* known by necessity to the people:
  - e.g. mocking the *siwāk* specifically,
  - then:
    - it is first *explained* to him that this practice is from the Sunnah,
    - if he *continues* to mock it *after* clarification, then he is a *kāfir*.

- You cannot make takfīr:
  - for mocking matters that are *not* maʿlūm min ad-dīn bi-d-darūrah
  - until *after* the proof is made clear,
  - and this “maʿlūm” can differ somewhat from time to time and from place to place.

- It is *obligatory* for the Muslim:
  - to believe that such a person (who mocks the dīn in this way, with the conditions fulfilled) is a kāfir.
  - If he refuses to see him as a kāfir:
    - then this falls under *Nullifier 3* (not considering the disbelievers to be disbelievers, etc.).

** Difference: mocking Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) and others

*** 1. Mocking Allah (عز وجل)
- If a person:
  - mocks Allah,
  - then repents and seeks Allah’s forgiveness,
- Allah is:
  - the One who forgives in this world and in the Hereafter.
- In this case:
  - he is not executed (the matter is between him and Allah, who may forgive him).

*** 2. Mocking the Prophet (ﷺ)
- If the mockery is directed at the Prophet (ﷺ):
  - he (ﷺ) has passed away,
  - seeking *his* personal forgiveness is not possible now.
- Therefore:
  - the ruling given by many scholars is that:
    - such a person is executed as a blasphemer.
  - There is *khilāf*:
    - some say if he repents he is not executed,
    - others say repentance is accepted for the *Hereafter*, but the *ḥadd* is still carried out in this world.

*** 3. Mocking the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)

- **ʿĀʾishah (رضي الله عنها)**:
  - If someone mocks her,
  - or accuses her of zinā,
  - after Allah has declared her innocent in the Qurʾān,
  - then he is a *kāfir* by *agreement*.
  - Even doubting her innocence is kufr.
  - Imām al‑Nawawī mentioned *ijmāʿ* on this.
  - Harming the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) is harming the Prophet (ﷺ),
    - and this is kufr by consensus.

- **The rest of the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)**:
  - Some say the āyāt of innocence are specifically about ʿĀʾishah.
  - However:
    - harming the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) is harming the Prophet (ﷺ),
    - so, according to the correct opinion,
      - mocking or slandering them is also kufr.

*** 4. Mocking Abū Bakr and ʿUmar (رضي الله عنهما)
- Whoever mocks Abū Bakr or ʿUmar:
  - regarding their *religion*,
  - then he is a *kāfir*.
- If he mocks them:
  - only about *worldly matters* and not religious matters,
  - then he is a *fāsiq* (sinner).
  - Imām Mālik said:
    - he should be *disciplined* (taʿzīr).

*** 5. Mocking all of the Ṣaḥābah
- Whoever says:
  - that the *majority* of the Companions have disbelieved,
  - then *he* has disbelieved.
- The Rawāfiḍ (extreme Rāfiḍī Shīʿah):
  - who declare most of the Companions to be kuffār,
  - are themselves upon kufr,
  - and this is the madhhab mentioned in these notes.

*** 6. Mocking practices attributed to Islām
- If someone:
  - mocks something that is *attributed to Islām*,
  - from the *practice* of the Muslims or the ʿulamā’,
  - then he is a *kāfir*,
  - when the matter mocked is from the religion.
- Mocking people:
  - because of their *religion*,
  - or because of their *adherence* to it,
  - falls under this.
- This requires *ijtihād*:
  - to determine what point exactly counts as mocking the dīn,
  - and what is just mocking a personal characteristic.
- The ruling is:
  - not about mocking the individual *as a person*,
  - but about mocking what is *from Islām* or what they do *for* Islām.

* 7. Sorcery (Sihr)

Sorcery, which includes magic spells that cause a person to hate something he seeks (ṣarf) or love something he does not seek (‘aṭf).  

So, whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done has committed disbelief.

Proof:

#+begin_quote
“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had said: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’”  
[Surah al‑Baqarah 2:102]
#+end_quote


** Reality and definition of sihr
- We are talking about **real magic**, not stage tricks and illusionary “magic shows”.
  - To *learn* real magic and *act* upon it is *kufr*.
  - Do not seek this knowledge; these are acts of disbelief.
  - A Muslim should not be *pleased* that it is performed.

- Linguistic meaning:
  - *Sihr* is anything that is *hidden* or whose *causes* are hidden from people.

- Definition (as mentioned in the lessons):
  - It can involve:
    - smoke,
    - putting specific things together,
    - tying knots, etc.
  - The magician:
    - does these acts *after* committing disbelief,
    - to bring himself close to Shayṭān,
    - and then, by Allah’s permission, it has an effect on the person he targets.

** Types of sihr
There are (at least) two types:

1. **Sihr ḥaqīqī (real, direct effect)**
   - Directly affects the person’s body, mind or life, for example:
     - making them weak or constantly tired,
     - putting them into depression,
     - preventing them from coming close to their spouses (sexual problems, aversion),
     - harming them or causing illnesses.

2. **Sihr taḫyīlī / takhyīlī (illusion in the mind)**
   - Affects a person’s *perception* and senses.
   - Example: the magic of the magicians of Pharaoh,
     - where ropes and sticks *appeared* to people as if they were moving.

- Magic:
  - cannot *actually* change the form of things into different substances,
  - but it is still *real* and has a true effect (by Allah’s permission).

** Danger and ruling
- The danger of sihr:
  - The magician becomes a *kāfir*,
  - because this magic can only be performed by committing acts of disbelief with the devils.
- The one who:
  - *performs* it,
  - and the one who *goes to* the magician and seeks this,
  - both fall under severe warning and share in the sin; in many statements of scholars, both are upon kufr if they approve and accept it.

** Signs that someone is a magician (not a legitimate rāqī)
- Asking for **specific details** not needed for ruqyah:
  - your full name,
  - your age,
  - **your mother’s name** in particular.
  - A genuine rāqī does *not* need this information.
  - Not everyone who *claims* to be a rāqī is a true rāqī.
    - Going to such people can remove you from the 70,000 who enter Jannah without reckoning.

- Asking for:
  - something you have touched that contains traces of you (hair, nails, clothes, etc.),
  - pictures of you or your relatives:
    - they can even take your photo from social media.
    - This is one of the problems of images being spread online: they can be used for shirk and sihr.

- Other common signs:
  - They like to use *bukhūr* (incense) in a strange way.
  - They prefer to work at *night* rather than during the day.
  - They recite words that do not make sense (unknown, jumbled language).
  - They may *mix* Qurʾān with strange phrases.
  - They ask for a particular animal with specific characteristics to be sacrificed.
  - They use **charts**, numbers and symbols.
  - They write broken pieces of Qurʾānic verses in strange forms.
  - They give **talisman** papers:
    - inside there is other than Qurʾān and Sunnah,
    - often symbols, grids, inverted letters, etc.
  - They may:
    - give you a paper and tell you to burn it and use the ashes as incense,
    - or tell you to dip it in water and drink it.
  - Women are often more inclined to go to such people than men (as mentioned in the lesson),
  - but this occurs in all lands and among all types of people.

** Protection from sihr
- *Tawakkul*: rely upon Allah.
- Increase in the *remembrance of Allah* (dhikr).
- Stay away from *sin*:
  - avoid things that are impure and corrupt the heart,
  - sins take away spiritual purity,
    - e.g. listening to music and other disobedience.
- Guard the *five daily prayers*.
- Recite **Sūrat al‑Baqarah** in the home.
- Recite:
  - *Qul aʿūdhu bi‑Rabbin‑nās* (an‑Nās),
  - *Qul aʿūdhu bi‑Rabbi‑l‑falaq* (al‑Falaq).
- Keep up the morning and evening *adhkār*.
- Recite the last two verses of Sūrat al‑Baqarah (2:285–286).
- Recite Āyat al‑Kursī before sleeping.
- Eating **seven ʿajwah dates of Madīnah** in the morning (as mentioned in the ḥadīth).
- Saying:
  - *Lā ilāha illa‑llāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lah* every day with the known number.

** How sihr is often done
- Placing something in your *food* or *drink*.
- Writing it on papers and:
  - giving it to you to keep,
  - or hiding it in the house, garden, clothes, etc.
- Tying *knots* whilst reciting satanic incantations.
- Reciting the magic and sprinkling something over a certain place.

** Ways it may be discovered
- During *ruqyah*:
  - when Qurʾān is recited, the jinn may begin to speak,
  - sometimes the jinn reveals where the sihr is hidden.
- Seeing it in a *dream*:
  - for example, repeatedly seeing a place, object or person,
  - then, when searched, sihr is found there.

** Verses and adhʿiyah used in ruqyah
- In principle:
  - The *whole Qurʾān* can be recited as a means of cure.
- Among the commonly recited passages:
  - Sūrat al‑Fātiḥah.
  - Sūrat al‑Baqarah (especially in the house).
  - Āyat al‑Kursī (2:255).
  - Verses from Sūrat Yūnus.
  - Verses from Sūrat Ṭā‑Hā.
  - Sūrat al‑Ikhlāṣ (Qul huwa‑llāhu Aḥad).
  - Sūrat al‑Falaq.
  - Sūrat an‑Nās.
- There are also specific *duʿā’s* from the Sunnah:
  - which can be recited as part of ruqyah and protection.

** Removing sihr

*** If it was ingested
- If the sihr was consumed in food or drink:
  - the aim is to *remove* it from the body (by vomiting or clearing the stomach).
- Some scholars mention using:
  - medicinal herbs such as *senna* (sunnā Makki / senna leaves of Makkah) as a laxative.
  - (This should be done with caution and, in practice, with medical awareness so as not to harm the body.)
- The idea:
  - is to cleanse the stomach and intestines,
  - and repeat (within safe limits) if pain or effects remain and there is a strong indication of sihr.

*** If it is written / tied / placed somewhere
- If written sihr is found:
  - remove the *ink* by washing it with water,
  - then tear the paper and dispose of it.
- If there are *knots*:
  - untie all the knots,
  - cut the material into small pieces,
  - while reciting over it:
    - verses such as al‑Falaq, an‑Nās, Āyat al‑Kursī, etc.
- If it is found in a particular area:
  - recite the relevant sūrahs and verses over that place,
  - then destroy/remove what was used for the sihr.

*** Important principle
- You *cannot* cure magic with magic.
  - It is *not allowed* to go to another magician to “undo” the first sihr.
  - Cure must be sought through:
    - tawḥīd,
    - duʿā’,
    - ruqyah with Qurʾān and authentic adhkār,
    - and permissible physical means.

* 8. Supporting the disbelievers against the Muslims

/Supporting and assisting/ the polytheists/disbelievers against the Muslims.
Proof:

#+begin_quote
“And whoever amongst you takes them as allies and protectors, then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allah does not guide a wrongdoing people.”  
[Surah al‑Maa’idah 5:51]
#+end_quote
** Categories of this nullifier

1. **Supporting them because of being pleased with kufr and enmity towards Islām**
   - The reason a person helps them is:
     - he is *pleased* with kufr,
     - and pleased with their enmity towards Islām.
   - Ruling: such a person is a *kāfir*.

2. **Supporting them in a way that strengthens kufr or weakens Islām**
   - The person may *claim*:
     - “I am not pleased with kufr,
      and I am not displeased with Islām.”
   - But in reality:
     - his alliance and support *either*:
       - raises and strengthens kufr,
       - or lowers and weakens Islām.
     - e.g. writing letters, spying, giving strategic information, political support, etc.
   - Ruling:
     - this is *kufr*,
     - because it gives victory to kufr over Islām in reality.

3. **Helping disbelievers against Muslims in a purely worldly matter**
   - The help given:
     - is not related to Islām or disbelief *as such*,
     - and does not give *kufr* victory as a religion.
   - Example:
     - two tribes (or groups) fighting over a worldly issue,
       and someone sides with the non‑Muslim side not out of support for kufr as a religion.
   - Ruling:
     - this is a *major sin* and oppression,
     - but *not* kufr in and of itself.

** Summary of the ruling
- Categories (1) and (2):
  - both are *harming Islām* and giving victory to kufr as kufr.
  - Therefore, they are *kufr*.
- Whoever allies with the kuffār in this way:
  - “he is from them,”
  - because no one truly allies with them in strengthening their kufr
    except that he is pleased with what they are upon.
  - He has shown *enmity* towards Islām:
    - so how can he be truly pleased with Islām in the first place?
  - Hence:
    - his ruling becomes their ruling.
- Any participation that:
  - *gives victory to kufr over Islām*,
  - is *kufr*,
  - whether he claims to “love Islām” or not.

** The story of Ḥāṭib and why he was not declared a kāfir

- Ḥāṭib ibn Abī Baltaʿah (رضي الله عنه) sent a letter to the kuffār of Quraysh:
  - informing them of the Prophet’s (ﷺ) plans regarding the conquest of Makkah.
- Allah informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of this:
  - the letter was intercepted,
  - and Ḥāṭib was brought before the Prophet (ﷺ).

- One of the Companions said:
  - “Let me execute this hypocrite (munāfiq)!”
- In another wording:
  - he was accused of nifāq.

- The Prophet (ﷺ) said (paraphrased):
  - “Leave him, for perhaps Allah has looked at the people of Badr and said:
    ‘Do whatever you wish, for I have forgiven you.’”

- So what stopped the ruling of kufr from applying to Ḥāṭib?
  - The scholars differed in analysing this.
  - Ḥāṭib explained:
    - he did *not* do this out of hatred for Islām,
    - nor out of love for kufr,
    - but because he had family in Makkah with no tribe to protect them.
    - He wanted to do something to protect his family worldly-wise.
  - When you bring the narrations together, Ibn Ḥajar and others mention:
    - it shows he only sent some *information*,
    - and it did *not* in reality give the kuffār an advantage that harmed the Muslims.
    - It was for a *worldly* gain/benefit with the kuffār,
      and not supporting them in their *religion* against Islām.

- Therefore:
  - when the Companion called him a kāfir/munāfiq,
    - the Prophet (ﷺ) showed that the matter was *not as it appeared*.
  - His action was a serious sin and mistake,
    - but because:
      - he did not intend to support kufr as a religion,
      - and the information did not truly give victory to kufr over Islām,
    - he was not taken out of Islām.

- This story:
  - clarifies the difference between:
    - the *general* ruling of this nullifier (supporting kufr over Islām = kufr),
    - and specific cases where:
      - intention,
      - the actual effect,
      - and other sharʿī considerations
    - may prevent the ruling of *apostasy* from applying to a particular individual.

* 9. Believing that some people are exempt from the Shari‘ah of Muhammad ﷺ

Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be /free of (implementing)/ the Sharī‘ah of Muhammad (ﷺ) – just as it was permitted for al‑Khidr to be free from the Sharī‘ah of Musa (عليه السلام) – then he is a disbeliever.

** Example: claim that certain “saints” are beyond the Sharīʿah
- Some ṭarīqah/Sūfī groups believe:
  - that their “saint” (walī) has reached such a high level,
  - that Allah is pleased with him to the point that he no longer needs:
    - ṣalāh,
    - fasting,
    - zakāh,
    - and other obligations of Islām.
- They think:
  - this person is *exempt* from the Sharīʿah,
  - just as they imagine al‑Khidr was exempt from the Sharīʿah of Mūsā (عليه السلام).
- This belief:
  - directly falls under this nullifier,
  - because it makes the Sharīʿah of Muḥammad (ﷺ) *not binding* on some of the creation.

** Al‑Khidr and Mūsā (عليهما السلام)
- There is a known difference of opinion:
  - Was al‑Khidr a prophet or not?
- The *correct opinion* (as mentioned in these notes):
  - is that al‑Khidr was a *prophet*,
  - because of what he was doing and practising:
    - such actions could not have been done except by *revelation* from Allah.
- Therefore:
  - he was not simply “breaking” the Sharīʿah of Mūsā,
  - he was acting upon revelation specific to *him* and his role,
  - and he was not under the *nation* of Mūsā in the same way as Banū Isrā’īl.

- The statement of al‑Khidr to Mūsā:
  - is *not* because of some “higher status” that makes him above Sharīʿah.
  - Rather:
    - every prophet is sent with a Sharīʿah for *his* people,
    - and Muḥammad (ﷺ) was sent for *all of mankind*.
  - Mūsā was sent to his people,
    - and al‑Khidr had his own specific assignment by revelation.
  - Al‑Khidr was not “tied” to Mūsā’s ummah the way Banū Isrā’īl were.

- Important point:
  - If Mūsā or al‑Khidr (عليهما السلام) were alive at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ),
    - they would *have to follow him*,
    - because Muḥammad (ﷺ) was sent for *all mankind* and jinn.

** Noone is exempt from the Sharīʿah of Muḥammad (ﷺ)
- If *anyone* could have been exempt from obligations due to status:
  - it would have been the Prophet himself (ﷺ).
- But what do we see?
  - he (ﷺ) was promised Jannah,
  - yet he performed:
    - ṣalāh,
    - fasting,
    - night prayer,
    - jihād,
    - and all acts of worship *more* than anyone else.
- The same applies to:
  - those Companions explicitly promised Jannah:
    - they did *more* deeds, not less.
- Conclusion:
  - *No one* is exempt from the Sharīʿah.
  - The claim that some people have reached a level where the Sharīʿah no longer applies to them:
    - is a *nullifier of Islām*,
    - and contradicts the universality and finality of the Sharīʿah of Muḥammad (ﷺ).
     
* 10. Turning away from the religion: not learning or acting

/Turning away/ from the religion of Allah, /not learning/ it, /nor acting/ upon it.

Proof:

#+begin_quote
“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the āyāt (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away from them? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the criminals.”  
[Surah as‑Sajdah 32:22]
#+end_quote

** Meaning of “turning away”
- This nullifier is about:
  - a person who *completely turns away* from the dīn:
    - does *not* learn it,
    - does *not* act upon it,
    - has no real concern for it at all.
- He is reminded of the āyāt of Allah:
  - but he turns away,
  - neither seeking knowledge,
  - nor practising anything from the religion in reality.

** Example: “Muslim by name”
- A person who is:
  - “Muslim” only by *name*,
  - this is the *only* element of his religion.
- Signs:
  - he has *no concern* for his religion,
  - he does not care about:
    - ḥalāl and ḥarām,
    - what Allah has commanded or prohibited,
  - he does not try to learn:
    - how to pray,
    - how to purify himself,
    - what is obligatory upon him.
- Islām requires:
  - a *minimum amount* of action and practice that manifests the shahādah,
  - not merely a word on the tongue with total turning away in reality.

** Clarification
- This is *not* the same specific ruling as:
  - the kufr of the one who abandons *ṣalāh* discussed under the nullifier of prayer,
  - nor is it about someone who is negligent but still:
    - attends Jumuʿah,
    - prays sometimes,
    - shows some attachment to the dīn.
- Rather:
  - it refers to *complete iʿrāḍ* (turning away) from the religion as a whole:
    - no learning,
    - no acting,
    - no concern,
    - only an empty claim of “being Muslim”.
* conclusion

- There is no difference in these nullifiers between:
  - the one who does them seriously,
  - the one who does them jokingly, or
  - the one who does them out of fear.

- The only exception is the one who does them while being coerced (under compulsion).

All of these ten matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. Therefore, the Muslim must beware of them and fear that he might fall into them.


We seek refuge in Allah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment.

May the peace and blessing be on the best of His creation, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), his family, and his Companions.
