#+title: The Foundation of the Knowledge of Usul
By sheikh Muhammad ibn Saleh al Uthaymeen (d. 1421 AH) may Allah (ﷺ) have mercy on him.


All praise is due to Allah; we praise him; seek his help and forgiveness; we repent to him; we seek refuge with Allah from the evils of ourselves and the evil of our actions. For whosoever Allah guides none can misguide and whosoever he misguides none can guide, I bear witness that there is not true god but Allah alone with no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad is his slave and messenger, may Allah's peace and blessing be upon him, his family, his companions and those who follow them until the Day of Judgement. 

To proceed, I have authored a concise treatise on the principles of jurisprudence, tailored to align with the curriculum prescribed for third-year high school student at institutes of Islamic knowledge. I have titled this work "The foundations of the Knowledge of Usul"

I ask Allah to make our actions purely for his sake and beneficial to his Servants; He is always near and responsive.

* Usul ul-Fiqh
The definition of Usul ul-Fiqh is understood in two ways:

First with regard to the first component "[[id:2c25cddd-1beb-4b1a-8626-a08231ef9a42][Usul]]" and the second "[[id:1316d477-4b3c-4b9b-9d0a-f9017c3f2521][Fiqh]]".

Usul is the plural of the word 'asl', and it means whatever can have something else built upon it ; from that we have the asl foundation of a wall which is in essence its base; likewise the foundation of a tree which has many branches sprouting from it.

As Allah (ﷻ) the most High says:
 #+begin_quote
 have you not considered how Allah presents an example, making a good word like a good tree. Whose root is firmly fixed and it's branches high in the sky? 14:24
 #+end_quote
 
"Fiqh". linguistically means understanding, as is the case in the statement of Allah (ﷻ)  the most High:
 #+begin_quote
  And untie the knots of my tongue. so that they many understand my speech
 #+end_quote

And it use in the science of jurisprudence is: knowledge of ruling of the Shariah along with their specific evidence. 

The term "[[id:6225c4e5-39bf-454c-b432-2c6073ad7c7e][ma'rifah]]" encompasses both knowledge and conjecture. This is because the ruling of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) can be understood through certainty or through speculative means, as is common in many fiqh issue. 

The term "[[id:4df624e4-c807-45de-84d5-69b8fff4e82f][al-ahkam as shar'iyayah]]" refers to legal rulings derived from religious legislation. These include determinations of what is obligatory or prohibited. It specifically excludes intellectual judgement, such as understanding that a whole is greater than any of it's part, and natural observation like the occurrence of rain on a clear winter night.

The term "[[id:97c40ef6-c0fb-45ac-bdbd-91025209fed9][al-'amaleyyah]]" refers to 'physical actions' and not cure doctrinal beliefs. This includes physical practise such as prayer and zakat. It distinctly excludes aspects intimately linked to belief's such as Tawhid (the oneness of Allah) and the understanding of Allah's names and attributes. Hence these doctrinal elements do not fall under the category of fiqh in jurisprudence.

The term "specific evidences" ([[id:c1d4bfaf-6fb9-4c19-b2a1-175c97b52f95][al-adillah at tafsileyah]]) refers to evidence in fiqh that are specifically related to detailed aspects of fiqh. This definition excludes the subject of usul ul fiqh which deals primarily with the general principles and broader evidence within fiqh

Secondly, when used as a term for this particular field of study, it is defined as; a discipline focused on identifying the general evidence used in fiqh, understanding how these evidence can be applied and determining the qualifications necessary for those who seek to benefit from this knowledge.

The term "general" ([[id:e7f4cb66-301f-4c32-afcc-026f4da91f32][al-ijmaliyyah]]) refers to broad principle or rules, exemplified by maxims such as ; a command implies an obligation, prohibition implies forbidance, and the validity of a transaction necessitate the execution of action that follow, such as the exchange of goods.

From this definition, we can conclude that specific evidence fall outside the scope of Usul ul Fiqh except when used illustratively to demonstrate a general rule.

The phrase "and how to make full use of them" ([[id:785116ff-2a6e-4d86-a4fe-538d65e2c0bd][wa kayfiyat ul-istifadata minha]]) refers to the understanding and application of methodologies that enables a jurist (faqih) to extract and apply rulings from the legal evidences efficiently. This involves analysing the language of the text, discerning nuances such as the general from the specific, the conditional from the unconditional, and identifying instances of abrogation. Such skill are essential for a faqih to effectively interpret and implement the evidence in deriving coherent and applicable legal ruling from the foundational text of fiqh.

The term "condition of the beneficiary" ([[id:6c506c91-b8fb-43c9-a509-21b85f9f4277][hal al-mustafid]]) pertains to the qualification and status of the individual who is capable of deriving leg rulings from the foundational text.

Therefore, a deep comprehension of the  nature of a mujtahid, the prerequisite for Ijithad, and its associated legal judgement are foundations aspects taught within the study of Usul ul Fiqh.


* The benefits of usul ul fiqh
Usul ul Fiqh is a distinguished and vital field of Islamic scholarship, providing profound rewards, it equips scholars with the essential skill and knowledge required to derive legal rulings form religious text accurately and reliably.

(The science ensure that the principle and methodologies employed are both rigorous and adherent to the spiritual and legal standards set forth in Islam, facilitating a deep and sound understanding of the law)

[[id:2dada820-43bc-4ab9-a532-d10230524921][Imam ash-shafi'i]], Muhammad ibn Idris, was the pioneering figure who established Usul ul Fiqh as a distinct discipline with Islamic scholarship. Following his ground breaking work, numerous scholars across generation have build upon his foundation, contributing extensive thought various forms of writing-prose, poetry and both concise and expansive volumes. This prolific scholarly activity have evolved Usul ul Fiqh into well defined and recognised fields, characterised by its unique feature and profound depth.

* TODO Rulings (Al Ahkam) pg 9
The term "[[id:948d05ba-0ec0-403a-b737-6f79eab474d2][Al-ahkam]]" (rulings), in its plural form derived form "hukm", refers linguistically to a judgement or decision. In the context of Islamic jurisprudence, it specifically denotes judgements that arise from the directives issued by the legislator - the Lawgiver, which in this instance are manifested in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. These directive address the actions of those who are deemed legally responsible (al-mukallafin) with the Islamic law. Such rulings mandate specific behaviour and choices or outline certain state, providing a structured guide on how to conduct oneself in accordance with divine legislation.

The phrase 'relating to the actions of those burdened with carrying out the obligation of the legislation' pertains to those aspects that involve active engagement, whether in speech or action, requiring individual to either perform specific acts or abstain from them. This definition specifically targets practical, observable behaviours rather than internal belief or convictions. Thus, within this scope, the term 'ruling' is applied only to those directives that influence physical or verbal actions, distinctly excluding matters purely of faith or belief, which do not fall under the category of 'rulings' in this specific juristic context.

The term "al-[[id:ba93d19b-37c1-40d2-9613-a01ac674fa21][mukallaf]]in" refers to individual who are deemed legally responsible and capable of bearing the obligation set forth by Islamic legislation. This category specifically includes those who have reached the age of maturity and are of sound mind, thereby excluding minors and those who are mentally incapacitated. The term 'mandated'(talab) in this context signifies the legal commands and prohibition issued by the legislator. These can be obligatory (which must be adhered to strictly) or recommended (suggesting preference but not strict enforcement).

The term 'choice' (takhyir) pertains to matter that are deemed permissible within the law (where the individual has the freedom to decide how to act). finally the term state wad' refers to being accepted or rejected, or other conditions or statues defined by the legislator through specific sign or descriptions. These dictate whether certain actions should be carried out or avoided, based on the context provided by these indicator.
  
* The types of Rullings in the Shari'ah

The types of commands (in the shari'a) falls into two categories Taklifyah and Wad'iyah

The Talifiyah are five; wajib (obligation), mandud (encouraged to understake), muharram (prohibited), makruh (disliked), and mubah (permissible).

1. wajid: linguistically means what have fallen or what is compulsory. Technically, (the context of Islamic law) it signifies an act or duty that the legislator has mandated as obligatory. Example of such obligatory act include the five prayers

so in this case, when we say "what the legislator has ordered by way of obligation," we are specifically referring to actions that are mandatory (wajib). This exclude:

Forbidden (Haram): (Actions that the legislator has explicitly prohibited).
Disliked (Makruh):(Actions that are discouraged but not sinful if performed)
Permissible (Mubah): (Actions that are neither required nor discouraged, and carry no reward of punishment)

Additionally, the statement 'by way of obligation' does not include actions that are Encouraged (Mandub) or Sunnah (which refer to acts that are recommended but not obligatory. Performing these actions brings reward, whereas neglecting them does not bring sin. This clarification is essential to differentiate between various levels of legal and moral responsibilities in Islamic law).

Therefore, something wajib is that which, if carried out, will bring reward to the one performing it, and the one fails to do so deserves to be punished. It also referred to as Fard, faridah, hatam and lazim.

2. Mandud: linguistically means something or someone appointed or designated. Technically, it refers to what the legislator has recommended but not as an obligation, such as supererogatory prayers.

Therefore, excluded from out statement 'what the legislator has ordered' are actions that are forbidden, disliked, or merely permissible. Additionally, excluded from the phrase 'not by way of obligations' are actions that are wajib

Thus, when an actions is mandud, the performer is rewarded for carrying it out but is not punished for omitting it. It is also known as Sunnah, mansnun, mustahab and nafal.

3. Muharram: linguistically means forbidden, and technically, it refers to what the legislator has explicitly forbidden as an obligation to avoid, such as disobedience to the parents.

Therefore, excluding from our statement 'forbidden by the legislator' are actions categorised as wajib (obligation), mandud (recommended), mubah (permissible). Furthermore, excluded from the phrase 'an obligation to avoid' are actions that are merely disliked

Thus, when something is muharram (forbidden), the individual who refrains from it is rewarded, while one who engages in it deserve punishment. This term is also referred to as Mahzur or mamnu.

4. Makruh: linguistically means something hatred. Technically, it refers to what the legislator has discouraged but not by way of obligatory or abandon, such as taking and giving with the left hand.

Therefore, excluding from our statement "forbidden by the legislator" are actions categorised as wajib (obligatory), mandud (recommended), mubah (permissible). Also exclude from the phrase "not by way of obligation" is anything that is muharram (strictly forbidden).

Thus, when something is makruh, the individual who refines form it out of compliance with the legislation is rewarded, but one who performs the actions is not punished.

5. Mubah: linguistically means something declared or permitted. Technically, it refers to what is neither connected with a command nor prohibited in and of itself, like eating during the night of Ramadan.

Thus, excluded form our statement  'what is connected with a command' are actions that are wajib (obligatory) and mandud (recommended). Also excluded form our statement 'not something prohibited' are actions that are muharram (forbidden) and makruh (disliked). The phrase 'in and out itself' excluded anything that acts as a medium leading to a commanded actions, thus becoming obligatory, or leading to a forbidden actions, thus becoming prohibited, which would alter its original status as mubah (permissible). When something is categorised as mubah (permissible), it remains within the bounds of permissibility, not resulting in reward or punishment for engaging in it. It is also refereed to as halal and ja'iz.

* Rullings of Wad'iyah pg 13
The rulings of wad'yah pertain to those indicators the legislator has set forth to determine the validity, implementation, or annulment of an action, distinguishing between what is valid (sahih) and what is invalid (fasid)
1. Sahih, linguistically, means something free from defect or disease. Technically, it refer to the legitimacy and effectiveness resulting from and act of worship or a contract.
   
For acts of worship to be sahih (valid), they must meet all necessary conditions, pillars and obligatory steps; this ensures the fulfilment of religious responsibilities. For instance, performing prayer on time with completed purification and adhering to all it's requirements is essential for its validity.

Regarding contracts, sahih (valid) implies that the consequence of the contract directly depends on it existence and fulfilment of all legal requirement, such a in a sale contract, the property and the terms of sale must be clearly defined and greed upon. A contract cannot be considered valid unless it meets all essential condition and is free from any hindrances that might invalidate it.

Examples of conditions and impediments in worship include the invalidity of a prayer performed without proper purification. In contract, an invalid condition would be attempting to see something not owned by the seller. An example of an impediment in worship is performing supererogatory prayer at times specifically prohibited by religious guidelines. In contracts, an impediment would be executing a sale during the Friday prayer after the second call, when such transaction are considered inappropriate.

2. Fasid, linguistically, means something that has been corrupted or is at a loss. Technically, it refers to action or contract that fail to produce their intended legal effect. Therefore, fasid (invalid) action of worship are those that do not fulfil the obligation required, resulting in an unmet religious demand, such as praying before the appointed time. Similarly fasid (invalid) contracts are those that are ineffective, like a contract to sell something unspecified or unknown.

All corrupt acts of worship, contracts and related condition are considered haram (forbidden); this is viewed as overstepping Allah's limits and mocking His verse, especially since the prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) forbade stipulating conditions that are not sanctioned by the Book of Allah.

While fasid (invalid) and batil (false) are generally synonymous, they differ distinctly in two specific scenario:

In Ihram: Fasid applies to violations by a person in Ihram, such as wearing stitched clothing or covering the head for males before the first restriction of Ihram are lifted. On the other hand batil (false) described more severs infractions, such as renouncing Islam while in Ihram

In Marriage: Fasid refers to conditions within a marriage that scholars have debated over, such as the validity of a marriage without a valid (guardian). batil, however, refers to conditions unanimously recognised as invalid, such as the marriage of a widow or a divorced woman during her waiting period, which is universally accepted as invalid.

(These distinctions highlight the specific legal consequence and religious implications associated with each term, reflecting the depth and complexity of Islamic jurisprudential terminology)

* Knowledge
time 11:40
The definition of knowledge involves the accurate perceptions of something as it truly is, coupled with a certain and confident awareness of it. For instance, understanding that the whole is greater than the part, or recognising that intention is a prerequisite for the acceptance of worship.

From out definitions, what is excluded from the phrase "the perception of something" is the incomplete or absent awareness of a face, which is termed jahl basit (simple ignorance). An example of this is when someone is asked, "When was the battle of badr" and responds, "I don't know".

Further excluded from our definition by the phrase "What it really is" is the misunderstanding or misperception of the reality, referred to as jahl murakkab (compounded ignorance). This occurs when a questions like "When was the battle of badr?" is answered with "in the third year after migrations,"which is incorrect as it actually took place in the second year after migration.

Lastly, what is also excluded form the phrase "firmly aware of it" it any tentative or uncertain perception, where the truth could potentially be different than perceived, such a state does not qualify as knowledge. If one leans toward one interpretation over another uncertain one, this is termed dhann (presumptions) for more liekly and waham (illusion) for the less liekly, this state is refereed to as shakk (doubt)

This categorisation illustrate that our understanding of realities can be classified into distinct cognitive state based on the nature of perception and certainty
1. Knowledge: This is characterised by the correct perception of an entity as it truly is, combined with as definitive and secure awareness.
2. plain ignorance (jahl basit): This occurs when there is a complete lack of awareness about a subject, leaving the individual without any knowledge of it. 
3. Compounded ignorance (Jahl murakkab): This involves a mistaken perception, where individual understanding is contract to the actual nature of the subject.
4. Shann: This is the perception where the individual leans toward a belief what many oppose is less correct view, implying a higher probability but not absolute certainly.
5. Wahm: This represents a perception where there is a significant possibility of the belief being contrary to the most accurate view, indicated a greater likelihood of error .
6. Shakk (Doubt): This state is marked by uncertainty, where the perceived reality could have an equally valid opposing view, leaving the individual in ambiguity.

(Each of these states reflect different level of clarity, certainty and accuracy in the perceptions of realities, impacting the validity of conclusions drawn from such perceptions)

* Categories of Knowledge
Knowledge, as a component of understanding and perception, can indeed be categorised into two primary types: essential and theoretical.

Essential Knowledge: This type of knowledge is intrinsic and almost instinctual. Individuals acquire this. knowledge effortlessly, without deliberate investigation or analysis. it include universally self-evident truths or fact that are generally accepted without question once encounter, such as the understanding that the whole is greater than it's part, that fire produced heat, or recognition of Muhammad (ﷺ) as the messenger of Allah. These are perceived as basic truth that do not require proof or extended reasoning.

Theoretical Knowledge: Unlike essential knowledge, theoretical knowledge requires active learning, reflection and analysis. It involves concepts and information that are not immediately apparent and typically require education or personal inquiry to understand. This category includes knowledge like the necessity of intention in prayer (theoretical knowledge often demands a degree of intellectual effort to acquire and understand.)

* Speech (Al-kalam)
time 12:51

The concept of speech encompasses both linguistic and technical definition that focus on the use of words to convey meaning.

Linguistic, speech is defined as words composed and employed to articulate specific meaning. it essentially refers to the act of expressing or conveying ideas, information or feelings thought the structure use of language, weather spoken or written

Technically, speech is described as words or phrases that are beneficial or meaningful, such as affirmation like "Allah is our lord" and "Our prophet is Muhammad (ﷺ) "(This highlight the important of speech in conveying significant and impactful messages)

Compositions of speech.
Speech is constructed from the basic element of language, typically involving at lead two component which could be nouns or a combination of a verb and a noun. Example of these structure include

a statement with two types of nouns: "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
a construction with a verb and a nouns: "Mohamed remained steadfast"

Element of speech
At its simplest, a single unit of speech is a word, which can be a noun, verb or particle, each carrying a distinct meaning:

The noun: Defined as a word that impacts meaning independently without the need to denote time. Nouns can be classified into three categories
1. general nouns : those nouns signify general concept or classes of object, such as relative nouns that could apply broadly across many instances.
2. absolute nouns: often seen in indefinite forms in affirmative context, these nouns express meaning that are unrestricted or not limited to specific instances 
3. specific nouns: these nouns denote particular entities or items, highlighted through defined article or context, making them distinct and identifiable.

(understanding these element's and their function in speech is fundamental in appreciate how language contract meaning and facilitates communication)

(The structure of peach in linguistic terms continues with verb and particle, which further enrich how meaning are conveyed)

B- The Verb: a verb is a word that inherently signifies a meaning and, based on its form, is associated with one of three tenses.

Past Tense: Example include verbs like "fatima" (he understood ), denoting actions that have been completed

Present tense: such as "yafhamu" (he understands), indicating ongoing or habitual actions

Imperative Tense: Exemplified by "ifham" (understand), used for command or request.

Verbs, regardless of their tense, suggest specific actions or states determined times by do not imply generality.

C- The particle: particles are word that imply meaning indirectly, relating to other elements within the sentence rather than holding independent meaning. some common participle include

1. Waw: used to denote association or conjugations between two elements, indicating that they are linked in some form of ruling. It neither commands nor negates by itself unless additional evidence suggest otherwise 
2. Fa: severs as a connector indicating sequence and immediacy between elements, it often implies causality or purpose, showing why something occurs following another event
3. Genitive Lam: this particle can express several meanings, including reasoning (why something is done), ownership (belonging to someone), and permissibility (allowing for an action)
4. Genitive 'Ala: Often conveys a sense of obligation, indicating that the actions described is required or expected


* Parts of speech
time 1:26

Speech is divided, with regard to its potential for truthfulness into two part al-khabr (news) and al-insha (that which is established)

Al khabr: This refers to statement that can inherently be descried as either truthful or untruthful. Excluded from out description of 'that which can be described as truthful or untruthful' is 'al-isha,' because it significance cannot be evaluated at true or false until it is revealed whether it is indeed a truth or a lie.

Additionally, excluded from our statement "in and of itself" are statement that have no potential to be either truthful or untruthful in relation to what they report. This is because the news regarding what it report fall into three categories
1. What cannot be described as lying, such as the khabar (information) from reliable source that is confirmed to be true that Allah and his Messenger said 
2. What cannot be described as honest, such as news that is inherently impossible by legislate or logical standard. The first example is the claim of someone alleging to be a prophet after the messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the second example involves contradictory phenomena, such as claiming that something is moving and being still at the same time 
3. There are statement that can be described as either truthful or untruthful, with varying degree of likelihood. An example of this is news that an absent person is arriving soon, where the truthfulness may depend on further context or evidence

2- Al insha (What has been established) refers to statements that cannot be described as either truthful or untruthful. This category includes commands and prohibitions (which are directive or normative in nature and do not assert facts about the world. these expression instead function to establish rules, obligation or express wishes, such as directives like "Stop!" or prohibition like "Do not steal.")

As in the saying of the Most High: 
"Worship Allah and associate nothing with him" 4:36

Speech can embody both khabar and insha simultaneously in certain context, such as in the proasing of a verbal contract. For example, in the statement "I sold and accepted", the phrase can function as khabar when it described the inten of the parties involved in the contract, indicating what has been agreed upon. Simultaneously, it acts as insha, as it establishes the contractual agreement and its ensuring obligations

Additional speech may be presented as news (khabar) but inteded as insha, and vice versa (often from specific benefits or purpose. This duality allows from flexibility in communication, adapting the form of expression to suit the intended outcome or effect within a given context)

The first example: the statement of the Most High:
"The divorced women should remain in waiting for three periods" 2:228
The phrase "they should wait for three periods" is structured as news (khabar), but the intent behind it is a command (insha). This stylistic choice serves to emphasise that action expected of the divorced women, treating it almost as pre existing state or established fact. By representing the command in this way, it underscores the importance and inevitability of the action, implying that it is a natural and expected behaviour. This method effetely strengthen the directive, framing it as n inherent attribute of those being addressed, thereby reinforcing compliance.

an example of the opposite is the verse
"And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, follow our way, and we will carry your sins" 29:12

The statement "we will carry" is presented in the form of an order (insha), yet the intended purpose is informational (khabar). The disbelievers are not actually proposing to take the  sins of the believers in a literal sense but rather asserting this claim to persuaded or influence the believers.

(The use of directive language here serves to portray their assertion as something compelling and obligatory, there by elevating the persuasive force of their statement. This rhetorical strategy position their claims as something serious and blinding, enhancing the impact of their argument even though it is essentially an informational statement about their false promise).
* Literal words and Metaphors
speech is divided in terms of usage to literal words and metaphroical words.

Literal words refers to terms used in their primary, original sense, which directly conveys the meaning they are commonly understood to represent. For example, "lion" refer to the well know large predatory cat.

- exclusion from "their primary, original sense",: This excludes term used in neglected or non-standard manner, which do not confirm to widely recognised definitions or usage. Such application are neither literal nor metaphorical; they are typically obscure or obsolete meaning not commonly understood.
- exclusion from "commonly understood to represent": This category explicitly exclude metaphors, where words are used not in their direct, primary sense but to signify something else by way of resemblance or analogy. For instance, calling a brave person a lion uses the word in a metaphorical sense, not its literal meaning.
  
Literal words can be further divided based on the context in which they are understood:

1. literal linguistics: This refers to words used according to the meaning assigned to them in a language. These are the definition generally accepted and understood by speakers of that language based on common usage and linguistic norms.

   Exclusion from literal linguistics: This category specifically exclude definitions that are derived from legal (shari'a) or custom context (These specialised meaning might not align with the standard linguistic interpretation because they are influenced by legal precedents or cultural practices)
   
For example, the term "Salah" linguistically mean supplication or prayer in a general sense.

(This is the meaning given by the speaker of the language without religious or legal connotation. However, in Islamic legal terminology, Salah refer specifically to the ritual prayer performed by Muslim, which include specific physical movement and recitation, a definition that goes beyond the mere concept of supplication).

(understanding the distinction between literal linguistic meaning and those shaped by legal or customary influences is essentials for clear communication, especially in context where practice definition impact the interpretation and application of concept)

2. Literal sharia (legislative) words: These refer to term that have specific meaning as defined by shariah (Islamic law). These definition are often precise and can differ significantly from the linguistic or customary meaning of the same words.
   
Exclusions form "by the sharia": This category explicitly excludes meaning that are based on customary usage or general linguistic interpretation. These secular or non-legal interpretations do not apply when the term are used in a legal Islamic context.

For example while the term prayer might linguistically mean any act of supplication or prayer, in a Shari context, it specifically refer to the formal ritual of worship in Islam, which includes a series of words and actions started with the takbir (saying "allhu akbar" to signify the start of the prayer) and the ending with taslim (saying "as-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah" to signify the end.) This precise definition encompasses the action and intention prescribed by Islamic law and it is this legal definitions that is meant when the term is used in discussion of Islamic practices.

(understanding the distinction between literal shari words and their linguistic or customary counterpart is crucial, particularly in a theological discussion, legal interpretation and the practice of Islamic ritual, ensuring that the term are used correctly within their intended religious context.)

3. literal customary words: these refer to words whose meaning are determined by the customs and practice of a community. This category emphasise how terms are understood in everyday life within a specific cultural or social context.

Exclusions form "literal customary words": This explicitly exclude meaning that are defined linguistically or by legislative frameworks.

(The focus here is on how words are used and understood in daily interactions among people within a particular cultural setting, rather than their strict dictionary definition or their specialised meaning in legal context).

For example, consider the word dabah, which in many cultural context refer specifically to a four legged animal. This is understanding of the term according to local custom and does not necessarily align with scientific classification or legal definition. The customary meaning reflect the common usage and collective understanding of the word within that culture

(Understanding the distinction between literal customary words and their linguistic or legislative counterpart is crucial because it helps ensure that communication is effective and appropriate within the given context. Knowing whether a word is being used according to community custom, linguistic definitions, or legal stipulations allows for clearer interpretation and helps avoid misunderstanding.)

Understanding that words have three distinct realities - linguistics, legislative, and customary - offers several benefits. By recognising these distinctions, we can ensure that each word is correctly understood and applied within it's respective context; linguist analyse words according to linguistic norm, legislator interpret them within the legal framework, and traditionalist understand them based on cultural customs.

(This awareness enables precise communication, effective interpretation, and cultural sensitivity)

B - The metaphor involves using a word for a purpose other than its original intent. For instance, likening a brave man to a lion. Excluded from this definition are words that remains unused, neither representing reality nor serving as metaphors. Additionally, the term "for other than the purpose it was intended" does not compass  reality.

it is impermissible to employ a word with its metaphorical meaning unless there is a valid evidence that prevents the intended realistic meaning, a principle known in the field of eloquence as a "qarinah".

The condition for using a word in its metaphorical sense is the presence of a connection between the literal meaning and the metaphorical meaning, ensuring the expression remains correct. This principle, known in the field of eloquence as a "link", can be established through similarity or other means. When the connection is based on similarity, it is termed at tajawwas isti'arah' (borrowing), as seen in the example of using lion to represent a brave man

If the connection is not based on similarity, it is termed 'at-tajawwas majaz mursul' (Metonym) when the metaphorical shift occurs in the word themselves, and 'psychological metaphor' when it happen in attribution.

an example of a metonym is saying "we took care of the rain" to mean pasture. This exemplifies 'at-tajawwaz' occurring within the word itself.

An example of a psychological metaphor is saying "The rain has given growth to the pastures". Here, the literal meaning of the words is understood, but attributing growth to the rain is metaphorical because true cause of growth is Allah. This is an example of at tajawwaz occurring in attributions

Also, the use of metonyms involves both additions and omission. An example of which is the statement of Allah the Most High: 
"There is none like him" 42:11

The letter 'kaf is added to emphasise the negation of anything resembling Allah the Most High

an example of metaphor by omission is the verse:
"ask the village" 12:82

i.e ask the villagers to respond. Here, the world people is omitted from metaphorical effect, and there are various types of such metaphorical instance listed in the science of eloquence (al-bayan)

Indeed, only some of the types of reality and metaphor in usul ul fiqh have been mention here.This is because the meaning of words can either real or metaphorical, necessitating the need to understand each one and it's corresponding ruling. Allah knows best.

The division of speech into fact and metaphor is well know among many later scholars, both in the qur'an and in other text. Some scholars assert that there is no metaphor in the qur'an. While other extant this assertion to all text. This view is was expressed by abu ishaq al isfaraini and later by the sholars skheik muhammad al-amin al-shinqiti.

They argued that this convention emerged after the three preferred centuries. skhiek al Islam ibn taymiyyah and his student ibn al qayim supported this view with strong evidence, which becomes apparent upon closer examination that this is the correct option.

* The Commands (Al-Amr)  pg 30

The definition of a command is: a statement that includes a requests for actions by a higher authority, such as "establish the prayer and pay zakat".

And what is excluded from our term "statement" is anything that is not communicated verbally, even if it implied a command.

Additionally, what is also excluded from out phrase 'the request of an action' is prohibition, as it entails requesting the cessations of an action, whereas the intent of a command is to prompt an action, including speech that is commanded to be uttered.

And what is also excluded from our phrase 'by way of higher authority' is appeals, supplications, and similar expression that may resemble commands in structure but do no carry the authority of a command.

** Forms of command
The forms of command are four:
1. The imperative verb, such as
   "recite [O Muhammed], what has been revealed to you of the book" 29:45
2. The imperative verbal noun, such as
   "Come to prayer" (from the adhan)
3. The verbal noun that is used in place of the imperative verb, such as:
   "So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle], strike [their] necks' 47:4
4. Present tense verb joined with the Lam of imperative, such as:
   "To believe in Allah and his messenger" 58:4

Commands can also be conveyed through means other than the standard forms mentioned above, for instance, a command may be indicated by describing it as fard, wajib,mandud or obedience, or by praising the performer and disparaging the one who neglects it. Additionally, a reward may be associated with its fulfilment, ore leaving it may incur punishment.

** What the wording of a command necessitates
The commands, when not contrained by other factors, entails the obligation of executing what is being commanded and doing so promptly.

For the evidence that it necessitates obligation in the verse:
"So let those beware who dissent from the Prophet's order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment" 24:63

The significance of this verse is that Allah has warned those who disobey the Prophet (ﷺ) commands to beware of a fitnah, which is a deviation, or face a painful punishment. such a warning implies that the general commands of the Prophet must b e obeyed, as neglecting them could lead to dire consequences.

From the evidence that it is to be carried out straight away in the verse:
"so race forward in doing good deeds" 2:148,5:28

The things enjoined by the shariah are inherently good, and the command to hasten towards goodness servers as evidence for the obligation to promptly engage in virtuous deed. For instance, the Prophet expressed displeasure when people delayed the sacrifice and shaving of their heads on the Day of Hudaybiyah, a matter he shared with Umm Salamah. Prompt actions reflect a sense of vigilance and righteousness, while delay can lead to complication and the accumulation of unfulfilled duties.


There are instances where a command, although give, may not be obligatory or demand immediate execution due to the specific evidence. In such cases, the command's status shifts from being an obligation to signifying something else, such as

1. Recommended - for example:
   "When you buy and sell have it witnessed" 2:282
   
   The command to have buying and selling witnessed is considered preferable according to evidence that the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) bought a horse from a Bedouin without having it witnessed.

2. Al-ibahah (permissible) often arises after a warning or in response to what might initially seem prohibited. An example of this occurring after a prohibition in the verse:
   "but when you come out of ihram, the [you may] hunt" 5:2
   
3. The command to go hunting is one of permissibility because it is mentioned after the warning, as is deduced form the verse:
   "Hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of Ihram"

And an example of when it is reply to what is perceived to be prohibited is the statement of the prophet (ﷺ) "Do it and there is nothing wrong", in reply to the one who asked during the final Hajj about doing the action on the day of Eid in a different order.

4. As a threat, as in the statement of the Most High:
   "Do what you like indeed He is ever-watchful over what you do" (41:40) and "So whoever wishes then let him believe and whoever wished, let him disbelieve. Verily We have prepared for the unjust a fire"

So, the warning is mention after the command is laid down proving that it is a threat.

And the command can be shifted from an immediate nature to one that can be implemented over time. An example of this is making up the missed days of Ramadan, because even though it is ordered to be done, the evidence indicate that it can be done over a period of time, as narrated by A'ishah:

"When I has to make up the fasting of Ramadan, I would make up for it what I could except in Sha'ban and that due to the Messenger of Allah's station." If delaying it was forbidden, then he wouldn't have allowed Aisha to do it.

Furthermore, a commands can also be carried out over time when what has been commanded cannot be completed expect with it.  So, if an action that has been commanded cannot be completed because of something, then that thing itself becomes commanded in order to fulfil the command. Similarly, if it is recommended, then the thing its by default recommended.

An example of an obligation is covering someone's 'awarah (part of the body that must be covered). if you are prevented from doing so without certain clothes, then buying those clothes also becomes an obligation.

An example of something recommended is wearing perfume on the day of Jum'uah. If it relies on buying perfume to carry it out, then buying the perfume is likewise recommended.

The principle is part of a more genreal principle: the means follow the rulings of the purposes they are being used for. So, the means undertaken to fulfil obligation are themselves obligatory, and similarly, those things that are prohibited render the means unlawful as well.



* The Prohibition (an-nahi)
The definition of a prohibition is a statement form a higher authority that includes a request to avoid doing something. It typical follows a specific format, using the present tense couple with the "laam" of prohibition such as the statement of the Most High":
"Do not follow those who deny Our revelation and who do not believe in the Hereafter" 6:150

What is excluded from our definition is the inclusion of "gestures", as it's not typically regarded as a form of prohibition, even if it conveys a similar meaning. Additionally, excluded form out description of "a request to avoid something" is the concept of command, which entail a request to carry out an action rather than to avoid it. Furthermore, excluded from "from a higher authority" are appeals, supplications, or other forms of expression that do not imply prohibition.

Also excluded form our descriptions of 'a specific format of the presence tense, etc' are expressiong that indicate a request to abstain from something but are in the form of a command (al-amr), such as "da" (Leave alone), 'utruk'(leave, abandon), and 'kaff leave off, among other. While these expression convey a request to stop, their form is that of a command rather than a prohibition. furthermore, prohibition can be conveyed through means other than the normal forms of prohibition, such as when the act is described as haram, severely warned against, distasteful or when the perpetrator is disparaged, or when a punishment is ascribed to it, and so forth.

** What the wording of prohibition necessitates
When left unrestricted, prohibitions necessitates the complete forbiddance of the action in question and render it invalid. This is supported by evidence such as the statement of the Most High:

"And whatever the Messenger give you then take it, and whatever he forbids you form then abstain from it" 59:7

So, the command is to cease what he has forbidden us from, necessitating our abstention from it, thus rendering it a prohibited act.

From the evidence that demonstrates the invalidity of certain actions is the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ): "whoever does an action that is not in accordance with our affair , then it is rejected", meaning it is reject if it goes against his teachings.

The principle according to the Hanbali school of thought concerning those things that have been forbidden, wheather they are correct or not is as follows:

1. The prohibition returns back to the very thing itself being prohibited or its conditions, thus making it incorrect.
   
2. The prohibition returns back to something other than itself or its conditions, therefore not being incorrect.

An example of the first principle in worship is the prohibition on fasting on the two days of Eid.

an Example of the first principle in dealing with other people is the prohibition of selling after the second call of prayer for whoever is obligated to observe Friday.

An example of the second principle is the prohibition of a man wearing silk. although covering his 'awrah fulfils one of the condition of prayer, if he covers it with a fordden cloth, such as silk, his prayer is invalid because of the prohibition return to the condition required for the prayer to be valid.

An example of the second principle in transaction is the prohibition on the sale of foetus. Knowledge of what one is buying is a condition for the validity of the transaction. if a foetus is sold, the transaction is not valid due to the condition of the prohibition.

An example of a prohibition return to an external issue in worship is wearing of a silk turban by a man. If he prays while wearing a silk turban, it does not invalidate his prayer because the prohibition does not related directly to the prayer or it's condition for acceptance.

An example of a prohibition returning to an external issue in transactions is the prohibition of fraud if something is sold fraudulently, that does not invalidate the sale itself.

Prohibition can sometimes encompass actions that are disliked or discouraged rather than explicitly forbidden, as evidence by the following instance

1. Dislike: For instance, the Prophet (ﷺ) advised against using the right hand to touch one's private part while urinating, state, "Do not let any of you touch his private part with his right hand when he urinates." Scholars suggest that the prohibition her signifies dislike, as the private part is part of the body, and refraining from using the right hand aims to maintain its purity.
   
2. Guidance. Another example is the Prophet's instruction to Muadh ibn Jabal, advising him to regularly supplicate after every prayer "O Allah, help me to remember You, give thanks to You, and worship You well", Although not explicitly obligatory, this guidance highlights the importance of continual remembrance, gratitude and devotion to Allah.

Who is addressed by the legislation is to implement commands and prohibitions? it is the mukallaf, an adult who has reached puberty and of is sound mind.

That is excluded from the term 'adult' is a child, who is not held to the same level of responsibility for commands and prohibition as an adult. However, a child is instructed to perform acts of worship to instill obedience to Allah and should be deterred form sins to foster habits of restraint.

Excluded from the term "sane" is an instance person, who is not held accountable for commands and prohibitions. Nonetheless, they are prevented form actions that may harm other or lead to perversion. Even if they perform an actions commanded, it is not considered valid if they did not intent to comply with the command.

This exemption does not apply to the obligation of zakat and financial rights of a child or insane person. These obligation are contingent on  specific condition, and once those conditions are met, the ruling applies based on the circumstance,  not the individual performing it.

** Accountability for Commandments and Prohibitons include Muslim and Non-Muslim

Both groups are obligated to obey the commands and refrain from the prohibitions. However the acceptance of deed differs between Muslim and non-Muslim. None-Muslims have their deed accepted even while they remain in a state of disbelief, as mention in the Qur'an:

"What prevents their expenditures from being accepted form them but that they have disbelieved in Allah and his Messenger" 9:54

Non-Muslims are not required to make up for their past deed if they accept Islam, as indicated in another verse:

"Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previous occurred will be forgiven for them" 8:38

Additionally, the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) informed Amr ibn al-as that "Islam nullifies previous actions." Therefore, a person is only punished if they die in a state of disbelief. This is evident from the quranic verse describing the response of the wrongdoers when question about their deeds.

"What put you into Saqar? They will say, We were not of those who prayed, not did we used to feed the poor, and we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged [in it], and we used to deny the Day of recompense until there came to us the certainty" 74:42-47


** Preventions for Accountability
pg 42 - time 8:48

There are circumstances that exempt individual from he obligations set by the shariah
1. Ignorance, forgetfulness, and coercion, The prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) stated: "Allah has forgiven my ummah for its mistakes; what they forget and they are forced to do". This hadith narrated by ibn Majah and al Bayhaqi and is supported by corroborating evidence form the Quran and Sunnah. If a person violates a prohibitions unknowingly, they bear no sin. For example, someone speaking during prayer without knowledge of the prohibition against it. Similarly, if one neglected and obligation without realising it necessity, they are not required to make up for it once the time has passed. An example is when the Prophet (ﷺ) did not instruct a person who prayed incorrectly, lacking tranquillity, to compensate for missed prayer. Instead, he direct them to perform the current prayer correctly.
2. Forgetfullness refer to the absence of mind regarding something known. If someone unintentionally commits a prohibited act due to forgetfulness, there is no sin upon them. An example is someone eating while fasting because they forgot they were fasting. Similarly, if a duty is forgetten, there is no obligation while in a state of forgetfulness. However, once a remembered, the duty must be fulfilled. This is supported by the saying of the Prophet Muhammed (ﷺ: "Whoever forgets the prayer, let him pray when he remembers" 
3. Coercion entails forcing someone to do something against their will. If someone is compelled to engage in a forbidden act, there is no sin upon them, such as being coerced into acts of disbelieved while maintaining faith in their heart. Similarly, if someone is compelled to neglect an obligation, there is no sin while under coercion, and they must fulfil it once the coercion ceases. For instance, if someone is coerced to miss a prayer until after its allotted time, they must make it up as soon as possible once the coercion ends.

These allowance are based on Allah's forgiveness and mercy concerning His rights. However regarding the rights of others, commitments must be honred unless the involved party choose to overlook them.

* The General (Al-'Am)
9:01
The term Al-'Am linguistically signifies inclusively. Technically, it refers to an all-encompassing word that incorporates all its individual elements without restriction: such as:
"The righteous are in bliss" 82:13, 84:22

What is excluded from our phrase "includes all its individual elements" is anything that pertains only to single elements, like a specific noun or an indefinite article in an affirmative context. For example, the verse:
"The freeing of a neck" 58:3
it does not encompass all elements inclusively but focuses on one unspecified element.

And what it not covered by the phrase "without restriction" is anything that addresses all its elements with restrictions, such as specific number like "one hundred thousand" and similar expressions.

** Forms of General (Al-'Am)
The seven types of wording which indicate genreality are
1. What shoes generality in itself - such as: kullu (every), Jami (entirely), Kafak (totality), qatibah (all without exception), and al-'Am (general): such as the saying of the Most High
   "Everything We have created with due propotion and measure" 54:49
2. Nouns of condition - like the saying of the Most High:
   "Whoever does a righteous deed then it is for himself" 45:15
   "Wherever you turn there is the face of Allah" 2:115
3. interrogative nouns - like the saying of the Most High:
   "Who is that will bring forth gushing water" 67:30
   "What did you answer the messengers" 28:65
   "Where are you going" 81:26
4. Relative nouns - like the saying of the Most High
   "And the one who has brought the truth and [they who] believe in it those are the righteous" 39:33
   "and those who strive for Us - we will surely guide them to Our way" 26:69
   "indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear Allah" 79:26
   "And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth" 3:129
5. The indefinite noun in the context of negation, prohibition or rhetorical question - like the saying of the Most High:
   "there is no true good but Allah"3:63
   "and worship Allah and join none with him" 4:36
   "If you reveal anything or conceal it, indeed Allah is the knower of everyting" 33:54
   "Which deity is there other than Allah that can bring light for you, do you then not hear" 28:71
6. The possession (noun) singular or plural, defined thought Al-idhafah (a possessive noun) - like the saying of the Most High:
   "mention the grace of Allah upon you" 3:103
7. The fined noun, singular or plural, by way of the definite article ("al" of inclusiveness)- like the saying of the Most High
   "And man was created weak"4:28
   "And when the children among you came of age, let also ask permission of those before them" 24:59

   in the context of defined nouns acknowledge by the 'al' article, their definition depends on the extent of acknowledgement. If the acknowledgement is general, then the noun is considered defined in general terms. Conversely, if the acknowledgement is specific, then the noun is regarded as defined in specific terms.

   An example of a general acknowledgement is found in the verse:
   "The lord said to the angels, I create man from clay. When I have breathed into him of my spirit and fashioned him, they prostrated to him. all the angels, every last one of them, fell done in prostraction" 38:71-47
   
   An example of specific is the saying of the Most High:
   o"As we sent a messenger to Pharaoh, so Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so we took hold of him in a severe way" 73:15-16
   When the "al" article defines a class noun, it doesn't render singular nouns as general. For instance, when saying "The man is better than the women" or "the men are better than the women" it doesn't imply that every individual man is better than every individual women, Rather, it suggest that the male gender as a whole is considered superior to the female gender, even though theere may be  individual women who surpass certain men in certain aspects.

** Acting on the general
time -932
It's imperative to adhere to the general implication of text until evidence suggest specificity. This is because the Quranic and Sunnah text require adherence to their general meaning until evidence indicate otherwise.

When we encounter a general statement stemming form a particular circumstance, we should still abide by its general implication . This focus is on the generality of the wording rather than the specific reason behind it, unless evidence specifically points to its particular application.

For instance , consider the case of zihar (a form of divorce where a man compares his wife to a relative). While it originated from a specific incident involving a companion, the ruling applies generally to anyone in a similar situation.

An instance where evidence specifies a general statement is found in the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: "it is not from righteousness to fast while travelling". The context behind this statement involves the Prophet encountering a man during a journey. The Prophet (ﷺ) was on a journey whereupon he saw a crowd and a man being shaded by them and said What is this, They said, he is fasting, he said, it is not from righteousness to fast while travelling. Uponthis observation, he remarked that fasting while travelling is not a righteous act. This generality becomes specific to those who share the circumstance of the man in question - specifically, when fasting becomes burdensome during travel.

The specificity of this ruling is evident from the Prophet own practice. He would fast during journey when it wasn't arduous for him, highlighting that he abstain from actions deemed unrighteous.
   
*  The Specific (Al-Khas)
 the term "al-Khas" linguistically denotes the opposite of "general" (Al-'Am). Technically, it refers to a word that is restrict to a particular person or a specific number, such as names of well known individual, demonstrative noun, and numerical values.

 Excluded from the definitions of "restricted" are nay element of characterised by generality.

 The term "Takhsis" linguistically represents the exact opposite of generalisation. Technically, it signifies singling out specific elements form what is general.

 An "Al-mukhasis" with an I - is the individual responsible for making things specific or customised (takhsis). This role is typically held by the legislator, and the evidence supporting taksis is also referred to using this term (mukhasis)
 Evidence indicating takhsis can be categorised into two types
 1. Connecting, referring to what cannot stand independently
 2. Separate, referring to what can exist independently

Therefore, one form of the connected specified, know as "Mukhasis al Mutasil" is the "Al-istithnah (exception)". Linguistically, "Al-istihnah" derives form "thana", which means to bend something with another part of itself, akin to tying a rope. Technically, it involves extracting specific elements from the general using the word "illa"(except) or its equivalent, as seen in the Quranic verse:

"indeed man is in loss except those who believe and do good work, and exhort one another to truth and exhort one another to patience" 103: 2-3

Excluded from this definition are methods of specifying something with a conditions or any other means beside "illa" or its equivalents.
** Conditions for Al-istithnah
For the validity of istihnah, certain conditions must be met:
1. It must be connect to the thing it is excluding, either directly or indirectly
   - Direct connection occurs when the exception immediate follows the thin it exempts without interuption 
   - Indirect connection is assumed when there is a break betwen them cause by something unavoidable, like coughting or sneezing, if the separation is cause by something avoidable, such as pausing or speaking other words, the exceptions is not valid, for example, saying  "My slave are free", pausing, and then adding "except sa'd" would not be valid, and all slaves would be considered free.
Some scholars argue that exceptions can be valid even with silence or a break in speech if it's part of a single speech act. They cite the hadith of ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ)  said on the day of the Conquest of Mecca, This country has been made sacred by Allah on the day he created the heavens and earth, it thorn are not to be popped up, nor its shrubs uprooted' So Al-Abbas said O messenger of Allah except idhker? He said: except idhker. This interpretation is support by the apprent meaning of the hadith.

2. The exception should not exceed half of what it is excluding
If someone say "I owe him ten dirhams except six", this exception is not valid, and the entire ten dirhams are payable. Some argue that this condition is unnecessary, and the exception remains valid even if it exceeds half, but the obligation is limited to the remaining amount (in this case, not more than 4 dirhams). However, if the entire sum is made an exception, it is not valid according to both position. For instance, if someone says "I own him ten expect 10", the entire ten dirhams are payable

This condition applies specifically to exception concerning number. However, if the exception pertain to a description, it remains valid even if most or all of the subject is exempted.

For example in the Quran Allah say to Ibless (Satan)
"Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviator" 15:42

Even though the follower of Satan outnumber the righteous, the exception still applies. Similarly if someone say "give to eveone in the hose except the wealthy", and it turns out everyone in the house is wealthy, the exception stands, and no one receives anyting.

Secondly, among the connected specified is the "shart" conditions, which in Arabic refers to a mark or sign. Here, it denotes connecting one thing to another, wether it is present or not, using the conditional "An" or one of it equivalents

The conditions is specific, whether it appears early or late in the text. An example of its early appearance is found in Allah's statement regarding the idolaters:

"But if they should, repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them go on their way. Indeed Allah is fogiving and merciful" 9:5

And an example of when it is delayed in the text is the saying of the Most High:
"And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] form among who you right hand possess - then make a contract which them if you know there is within them goodness" 24:33

Thirdly, among the connected specifiers is a description, which involves specifying certain individuals from a general group using an adjective, substitute (badl), or state (hal).

And example of this is found in the Qur'an verse:
"From those whom your right hand possess of believing slave girls" 4:25

The example of substitute in the saying of the Most High:

"And due to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage for the House - for whoever is able to find there to away" 3:97

And example of a state (hal) is the saying of the Most High:
"But whoever kill ad believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah as become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared him a great punishment" 4:93

** The sperate Mukhasis

The separate specifier is independent and consist of three elements: sense, reason and legislation

An example of specification by sense is found in the quran verse about the wind of 'Ad:
"Destroy everything by command of its' lord" 46:25

Here, the sense indicate that the wind did not destroy the heaven and the earth, and example of taksis through reason is the saying of the Most High:
"Allah is the Creator of All things" 39:62

The mind indicates that Allah is not created. Some of the scholars hold the view that what is made specific by the sense and intellect is not from the general that is made specific, rather it is from the general which is inteded for being specific, so the intent of the speaker or the addressee is not the specific in the first place, and is a general reality which a specific one (as the saying of the Most High) is intended by.

As for takhsis of legislation, then the Book and the Sunnah is made specific by each other as well as by Ijma and analogy.

As an example of the Quran making specific other part of the Quran, note the saying of the Most High: 
"Divorced women remain in waiting for three period" 2:228

This is made specific by the saying of the Most High
"O  You who have believed, when you marry a believing women and the divorce them before you have touched them, then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them"33:49




time 10:13
pg

7:24am
For example of how the Quran is made specific by the Sunnah, take the verse of inheritance, as the saying of the Most High: 
"Allah instruct you concerning your children: for the male what is equal to the share of two femails" 4:11

And the like are made specific by the saying of the Prophet:
"The Muslim must not inherit from the infidel and the infidel must not inherit from the Muslim"

For an example of the Qur'an being made specific by consensus, the saying of the Most High:

"And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witness - lash them with eighty lashes" 24:4
...is made specific by consensus that the slanderous slave is to be flogged forty time instead, and like this many of the people of usul give example, although there is some proven disagreement in this, I have not been able to find a sound example which is free from disagreement.

an example of the Qur'an being made specific through analogy is the saying of the Most High:
"The unmarried women or unmarried man found guilty of sexual intercourse - last each one of them with a hundred lashes" 24:2

This has been made specific by analogy to fifty lashes for the slave adulterer with the slave girl and this option is most well-known.
An example of the Sunnah being made specific by the Qur'an is the statement of the Prophet (ﷺ).
"I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no true God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah..."

This has been made specific by the saying of the Most High:
"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and his Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - fight until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled".

An example of the Sunnah making specific something from the Sunnah is the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ):
"on a land irrigate by rain water or by natural water channels or if the land is wet due to nearby water channels Ushr (i.c one tenth) is compulsory (as zakat)" and on the land irrigated by the well, half an Ushr (i.c one-twentieth) is compulsory (as Zakat on the yield of the land).

I have not been able to find an example from the Sunnah being made specific by concensus.

Lastly an example of the Sunnah being made specific by analogy is the saying of the prophet (ﷺ):

"The virgin with the virgin is one hundred lashes and banishment for one year"

This has been made specific by analogy for the slave man and women it is limited to fifty lashes, this is what is well known.
* The absolute and restricted
The definition of Absolute (al-mutlaq): Al-mutlaq linguistically means the opposite of unrestricted, and technically it means: whatever indicates a reality without a restriction as the saying of the Most High.
"The freeing of a slave before they touch one another " 58:3

What is excluded from our words: "Whatever indicates a reality" is the general (al-Am)  because it indicates the generality of something whereas the Absolute indicate the absolute nature of a particular reality. And what is also excluded from our word "restricted" is unrestricted.

The definition of Restricted (Al-muqayyid ): restricted linguistically means whatever is used to restrain a camel and the like, and technically means: whatever shows the reality of something but with a restriction such as the saying of the Most High:

"Freeing a believing slave" 4:92

Acting on Absolute (al-mutlaq): Al-mutlaq (text) must be acted upon in according to it apparent meaning (of absoluteness) until evidence restricts it. This is for the reason that acting on the Qur'an and Sunnah is an obligation and must abide by what is apparent unless other evidence show us otherwise.

When an absolute text and a restricted on address the same issue, the restricted is applied to the absolute text. However, if they pertain to different matters, both text are followed, with the restriction of one an the absoluteness of the other taken into account.

An example of when the issue of both text is addressing one issue, is the saying of the Most High in expiation of zihar (pronouncing one's wife as the back of his mother intended by it divorce):

"The freeing of a slave before they touch one another" 58:3

And his saying about the expiation for murder:

"Freeing a believing slave"  4:92

The ruling remains consistent: the freeing of a slave, therefore, we must qualify the absolute nature of the first verse concerting the expiation of zihar by restricting it to the freeing of a believing slave, which aligns s with the restriction specified in the verse regarding the expiation for murder consequently, in both cases, the slave being freed should be a believer.

An example for when the ruling is for different issues is the saying of the Most High:
"as for the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands" 5:38

And his saying in the verse regarding ablution:
"Wash you're faces and your forarms to the elbows" 5:6

Here although the ruling may seem similar, there is a difference, the first verse mention cutting, while the second mentions washing. Therefore, we do not qualify the first text by the second: the first verse remains absolute, specifying that the cutting should be from the write. Similarly, the second verse remain restricted, indicating that the washing should be done up to and including the elbows.

* The Obscure and The clarifying
pg 62 time 807

The Definition of  Obscure (Al-mujmal)
Obscure linguistically denotes something vague or accumulated. Technically, it refer to what cannot be understood without futher specification, clarification of its description or determination of it quantity.

And example of what needs something to specify it is the saying of the Most High:
"Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods"2:228

The term "al-qar" is ambiguous, encompassing both menstruation and purity. Therefore, clarification is needed from evidence to determine which meaning is intended in given context.

An example of what needs something else explaining it's description is the saying of the Most High:
"And establish the prayer" 2:43

Indeed establishing the prayer is unknown and needs to be explained.

An example of what needs something else explaining its amount is the saying of the Most High:
"And pay Zakat" 2:43

Similarly, the specific amount of Zakat that must be paid is not specified in this verse and require clarification for other source.

** The definition of the Clarifying (Al-mubayyin)
Linguistically. "Al-mubayyin" refers to clarifies or explainer. Technically, it denotes when the meaning is understood directly for the word itself in its original form or after clarification. For instance, words like "sky", "land", "mountain", "justice", "injustice", "sincerity", and others are self-explanatory and do not require futher clarification. An example for what is understood after clarification is the saying of the Most High:
        "And establish the prayer and pay the zakat"
        
The establishing the prayer and paying zakah are both unclear, but the legislation has explained them, so both words have become clear after they have been explained

Acting upon Mujmal (ambiguous) texts:
The Mukallaf (responsible individual) must act upon the Mujmal when its explanation becomes clear to him. The prophet (ﷺ) elucidate all aspects of legislation, its principles, and subsidiary matters to his followers. He left behind a clear and unambiguous path for his nation, with its night resembling its day, without leaving any ambiguity unresolved.
The Prophet's explanations were convey either orally, thought his actions or through a combination of both. For instant he orally specified the amount and set the limit of Zakat, such as his statement: "A tenth of whatever is watered by the sky", which clarifies the general directive of the verse
"And pay the Zakat" 2:43

An example of him explaining through action is establishing the ritual of Hajj in front of all his followers making clear the generality of the saying forthe Most High:
"And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way" 3:97

indeed, the Prophet's practical explanation were profound. For instance, his observance of the eclipse prayer according to its prescribed manner served as a practical elucidation of his statement: "if you see any of it then pray". Similarly, his combination of words and prayer, as narrated in the account of the man who prayer incorrectly where he said, "If you go to prayer, complete the ablution properly, then face the Qiblah and say Allah hu Akbar". until the rest of the narration.

Moreover, his action alone also served as instructive demonstration. For instance, in the narrations of Sahl Ibn Sa'd as Sadi, the prophet (ﷺ) led the prayer from the pulpit, initiating with "Allahu akbar", and the congregation followed suit. Subsequently, then turned to them and elucidated, "I have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayer"

* The Apparent and The Interpreted
The definition of Apparent (Ad-Dhahir)

The term "Apparent" (Ad-Dhahir) carries a linguist connotation of clarity and visibility. Technically, it dentoes what it most likely in meaning, although other interpretation are possible. For instance, consider the Prophet's (ﷺ) statement: "Make ablution after (eating) camel meat." Here, the apparent meaning of ablution refers to the prescribed ritual ablution , not merely washing oneself.

What we exclude from "most likely in meaning" is anything categorised as al-Mujmal because it doesn't independently conveys a specific meaning. Additionally, we exclude from "most likely in meaning" the interpreted, as it would suggest a less accurate view without an external factor. Lastly, what we exclude from "although other interpretations are possible" is the clear text, which conveys only one definitive meaning.

Acting upon the Apparent (text)

Acting upon the apparent text is obligatory unless there is evidence that deviates from its apparent meaning. Adopting this approach is more cautions, ensures greater fulfilment of responsibility, and strengthen worship compliance with the legislation.

The definition of interpreted (Al Mu'awwal)

Al Mu'awwal linguistically comes from the word "al-awal", which means the first or returning. Technically, it refers to when the wording implies the less likely meaning. Therefore, what is excluded from our definition is the text and the Apparent. The text implies only one meaning, while the Apparent suggest the most likely one.

And interpretation is of two types: acceptable and rejected
1. The acceptable (interpretation) is what is indicated by sound evidence: such as the saying of the Most High: "and ask the village (i.e the people of it)". As for the village then it is not possible to ask it directly
2. The rejected (interpretation) is what one does not have sound evidence (to support it), such as the interpretation of Mu'atilah (deviant sect) regarding the saying of the Most High: "The Most Merciful rose above the throne".

[They changed the meaning of istawa (rose)] to meaning of "istawlah" to conquer, whereas it's correct interpretation is of highness and establishment without asking how or making similitude.

* Abrogation (An-Naskh)
Abrogations, linguistically, entail removal or copying. Technically, it refers to the removal of a legal ruling or its wording, replaced by another evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah. By "remove a ruling", we mean changing from obligation to permissibility or vice versa.

However, this does not encompass situations like non-implementation due to condition or preventive factors. For instance, the obligation of Zakah may be lifted due to not meeting the set limit, or the obligation of prayer during menstruation; these instance are not termed as abrogations.

Regarding "or its wording", it refers to the legal proof within the text because abrogation can involve either the ruling without the wording or vice versa, or both. Not included in this definition are evidence from consensus and analogy, as they cannot abrogate.

Indeed, abrogation is intellectually acceptable and legal reality in Shariah. Intellectually, it aligns with the understanding that Allah possesses absolute power and authority, being the ultimate owner and legislator. Thus, He may enact laws as He sees fit, guided by His wisdom and mercy for His servants. It's reasonable to acknowledge that the possessor orders his possession as He deems appropriate.

His wisdom and mercy necessitate legislation that serves the best interests of His creation in both worldly life and the hereafter, recognising that circumstances and benefits vary over time and places.

Therefore, ruling that is beneficial at one time or state may differ in its applicability or benefit at another time. Allah, being All-knowing and All-Wise, decree what is most beneficial for His servant based on His perfect knowledge and wisdom.

As for its occurrence in the Shariah then the evidence are many, from them:
1. The saying of the Most High:
   "We do not abrogate the verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it" 2:106
2. The saying of the Most High:
   "Now, Allah has lightened [the hardship] for you" 8:66
   "So now, have relations with them" 2: 187
   This text was revealed to change the previous ruling.
3. The saying for the Prophet (ﷺ)
   "I used to forbid you from visiting graves so visit them (from now on)"
   This text abrogated the prohibition of visiting the graves.
** What prevents abrogation taking place
Abrogation is prevented from the taking place in the following:
1. News: Abrogation is prevented from occurring in matters of news because it deals specifically with rulings. In cases where a ruling is conveyed in the form of news, abrogation can still apply. An example is found in the Quran, where Allah initially state:
   
   "if there are among you twenty [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred" 8:65
   
   This statement conveys a ruling in the form of news. However, in the very next verse, Allah abrogates this ruling with:
   "Now, Allah has lightened [the hardship] for you, and he knows that among you is weakness. So if there are from you one hundred who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred" 8:66

Here, the initial ruling is replace by a new one, demonstrating the occurrence of abrogation even in matters initially presented as news.

2. Indeed, rulings that are universally beneficial, applicable in every time and place, such as the principle of Tawhid, the fundamental tenets of faith, and moral virtues like honesty, chastity, generosity, and courage, cannot be subject to abrogations. Similarly, prohibitions against universally recognised evils such as Shrik and Kufr, as well as immoral behaviour like lying, immorality, greed and cowardice, remains constant across all ages and regions. These laws are established for the welfare of humanity and to prevent harm and corruption. Therefor, they are immutable and not subjected to abrogation.

** Conditions of Abrogation

The conditions for abrogation that are required for what can be abrogated include:

1. Incompatibility of Evidence: Abrogation requires two piece of evidence that cannot be reconciled or combined, as their simultaneous application would render abrogation unnecessary. If compatibility exists, abrogation does not apply.
2. Chronological Sequence: it is essential to establish that the abrogating text was revealed later than the abrogated one. This knowledge can be obtained from explicit texts, reports from companions, or historical context. For instance, the Prophet's statement about the prohibition of temporary marriage indicates a later revelation, he said, "I authorised you to enjoy women (through temporary marriage), indeed Allah has now forbidden it until the Day of Resurrections."
   
And an example of knowledge reaching us by way of information from a companion is the statement of A'ishah, who reported that it had been revealed in the Holy Qur'an that then clear breast feeding make the marriage unlawful, the it was abrogated (and substituted) by five breast feedings.

And an example of knowledge garnered through history occurs in the saying of the Most High : Now Allah has lightened the burden from you. The word 'now' indicates that this ruling is the latter (of whatever preceded it of the same issue). Similarly, if it were stated that the Prophet (ﷺ) gave a ruling for something before the migration, and then gave another ruling after that which opposed the first then the second one would be counted as the abrogating one.

3. Validation of the abrogating text. The majority has stipulated that the abrogating text be stronger than what is abrogating or at least similar, there the mutawatir (the narrations that has multiple narrators) would not be abrogated by narrations that are ahad (narrations that have a single narrator at each level of the chain), even if it is established (as correct narration), what is most correct is that it not be stipulated whether or not the abrogating text be stronger or similar, reason being the purpose of the abrogation is the ruling, and so it should require it to be mutawatir for it to take place.

** Categories of Abrogation
Abrogation is divided into three segments with regards to the abrogated text:

1. When the ruling has been abrogated and the wording has remained, this is frequent in the Qur'an. An example of which are the two verse of patience:

"if there are among you twenty who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred" 8:65

Its ruling abrogated by the saying of the Most High:
"New, Allah has lightened the hardship for you, and he knows that among you is weakness. So if there are from you one hundred who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are among you a thousand, they will overcome two thousand by the permission of Allah. And Allah is with the steadfast." 8:66

And the wisdom of abrogating the ruling and not the verse is to allow the reward of reciting it to remain, and a reminder to the Muslims of the wisdom behind the abrogation.

2. When the wording has been abrogated but the ruling remains, such as the verse of stoning. Indeed it has been established in Bukhari and Muslim from the narration of ibn Abass and Umar bin Al Khattab said: "The verse of stoning was amongst the other verse that Allah revealed in the Qur'an so we read it and understood it properly and the Prophet (ﷺ) stoned and we stoned after him, but I fear after a the passing of time people will come to say:"

   "By Allah we do not find the verse of atoning in the Book of Allah! So they will become misguided by leaving an obligation that Allah has revealed, even though stoning is in the Book of Allah, a right upon those that commit fornication/ adultery from the chaste men and women, and if the evidence is established, the women is pregnant or if there is an acknowledgement".

The wisdom of abrogating the wording but not the ruling is to text the Ummah to see if they will act upon something that is not in the Qur'an and fulfilling their belief in what Allah has revealed the exact opposite of the state of the Jews that tried to hide the verse of stoning in the Torah.

3. What has been abrogated both in wording and ruling: such as the abrogation of the ten breast feedings as in the previous narration of A'ishah

** The Abrogating Text
Abrogation is divided into four categories with regards to the abrogating text

1. Abrogation of the Qur'an by Qur'an like the verse of patience (mentions above)
2. Abrogation of the Qur'an by the Sunnah: I have not found a proper example for this.
3. Abrogation of the Sunnah by the Qur'an: an example of which is the abrogation of facing the Sacred House in Jerusalem which was established by the sunnah, to facing the ka'bah which was in turn established by the saying of the Most High:
   "So turn your face toward al-masjid al-haram. And wherever you believers are, turn your face toward it in prayer"
4. Abrogation of the Sunnah by the Sunnah, and example of which is the saying of the Prophet:
   "I had forbidden you from the drinking (and preparation of) Nabidh in the vessels made out of leather, but (now) you may drink in all vessel, butt do not  drink intoxicants"
** The Wisdom of Abrogation
There are many wisdom for Abrogation; from them:
1. Taking into account the interest of people by legislating what is best for them in their religious and worldly affairs
2. Gradually developing the legislation until it reaches perfection
3. Testing the mukllafeen, their readiness to accept the transition from one rule to another and being content with it
4. Testing the mukallafin to see if they give thanks for when the abrogation make things lighter for them, to see if they are patient when the abrogating text is harder for them.
* Al-Akhbar

The Definition Al-Akhbar linguistically means news. But what is intended here is: that which is attributed to the Prophet (ﷺ) speech, actions, tacit approval or description.

we've previously mentioned about the fulling of the Prophet (ﷺ) speech.

Types of Actions of the Prophet (ﷺ)
The actions of the Prophet Muhammed (ﷺ) can be classified into different categories
1. Natural Disposition. These are actions that are apart of his innate human nature, such as eating, drinking and sleeping. While they do not inherently constitute rulings, they may be commanded or prohibited based on specific reason or sought-after descriptions, like eating with the right hand.
   
2. Habitual Actions. These are actions performed by the Prophet based on his personal habits, such as his choice of clothing. While the actions themselves may be permissible, they may be recommended or discouraged for other based on additional factors.
   
3. Exclusive Actions. These are actions performed uniquely by the Prophet that are specific to him alone, such as continuous fasting for days without interruption or marrying women without a guardian. Exclusivity is not assumed for other individual unless there is evidence to support it, as the norm is to follow the Prophet's example.

4. Worship Actions. These are actions performed by the Prophet in worship to Allah, which were obligatory for him until he received divine  orders to proclaim their obligation. Afterwards, they come recommended for him and the community based on the most correct opinion, that is because of the fact that if he did something, it indicate that it has basis in the Shariah, so the norm is that there is no punishment for leaving the actions, as it is legislated without any punishment for leaving it, and this is the reality of mandub (recommended)

   An example of that is the narration of A'isha when she was asked what the Prophet began with when he entered his house? she said "With the siwak", there is nothing in the siwak whilst entering the house except an action, so it is mandub

   Another example is the Prophet wiping his beard by passing his finger through from behind his beard to the front in a combing motion during wudo. This action is not considered a part of washing the face; and it is only an action so it reaches the level of mandub

5. Clarifying Ambiguities: The Prophet's actions often served to elucidate ambiguous text from the Quran and Sunnah, initially obligatory for him until clarification was received, these actions helped clarify the rulings for both him and his followers. If the clarified ruling is obligatory, the action becomes obligatory; if recommended, it becomes recommended for both the Prophet and his follower.

   An example of an obligation is the obligatory action of the prayer that the Prophet (ﷺ) did, thereby removing the ambiguity of the saying of the Most High:
   "And establish the prayer" 2:43

   And example of mandub: His praying of two units behind the station of Ibrahim after completing the tawaf enacting the saying of the Most High:
   "And take the station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer" 2:125

   By going toward the station of Ibrahim, while reading the verse, and offering two rak'ahs as a Sunnah

The approval of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) serves as evidence of the permissibility of a particular action or statement in the manner it was approved by him. This applies whether it pertain to speech or action.

For instance, his approval of a statement is exemplified by an incident where the questioned a slaved girl about the whereabout of Allah, and upon her repsonce that he "above the sky" he approved of her answer.

Similarly, his approval of certain actions is demonstrated in various instance. For example, when the Prophet (ﷺ) learned that a companion regularly recited Surah al-Iklas in every rak'ah of his prayer out of love for its description of Allah's mercy, the Prophet (ﷺ) praised him and conveyed Allah's love for him.

Another illustration is his approval of Abyssinians playing in the mosque to draw them closer to Islam.

Action that occurred during his lifetime but of which he was not aware cannot be directly attributed to him. However, they serve as evidence of Allah's approval, as highlighted by the practice of 'Azl (coitus interruptus) during the revelation of the Qur'an. The companions cited this as evidence of it permissibility reason that if it were prohibited, the Qur'an would have explicitly addressed it.

The fact that reprehensible actions attempted to be concealed by hypocrites were exposed and condemned by Allah further underscore that his silence on certain matter signifies their permissibility. This indicate that actions or statement approved by Allah, even if not explicitly addressed in revelation, are deemed permissible.

** The categories of news in light of who they are attributed to

News is divided into three categories with regards to who they are attributed to: Marfu', Mawquf and Maqtu'.

1. Marfu': What is attributed to the prophet (ﷺ) in actual terms or through a judgement (he passed) .
   
   As for marfu in actual terms, it is the words of the Prophet (ﷺ), his actions and tacit approvals.
   
   And marfu' through judgement is what is attributed to his Sunnah, or his reign or the like and whatever shows that he had no direct contact with, such as the saying of a companion: We have been commanded or forbidden etc, as in the words of ibn Abbas "The people were commanded to make the last they do before leaving Makkah: tawaf of the Ka'bah, except for menstruating women" And the words of Umm Atiyah: we were forbidden to follow the funerals procession..
   
2. Mawquf: What is attributed to a companion but not proven to be from the Prophet himself, then the most correct opinion is this can be used as an evidence except in the case where it contradicts a text (Qur'an and Sunnah) in which case we go by the text, or that it contradicts the statement of another companion, then the most correct opinion is taken of the two. A companion is whoever met the Prophet, believed in him and died upon that.

3. Maqtu': What is attributed to a Tabi'i and anyone after him.
   The Tabi'is is whoever met a companion as a believer and died upon that.

** Categories of news with regards ot its chians (of narrations)

News can be divided into Mutawatir and Ahad with regards to it chains of narrations:

1. Mutawatir: definition: News narrated by many people, making it virtually impossible for them to have conspired to lie.
   
   Example: The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) statement: "Whoever deliberately lie about me, let him take his place in the Fire".
   
2. Ahad: definition: news with a lesser number of narrators compared to Mutawatir.
   Further divided into:
   a. Sahih (Authentic): Narrated by an upright individual with precise recollection, featuring a connected chain of narration without anomalies or hidden defect.
   b. Hasan (Good): Narrated by a generally pious individual with reasonable precision and a connected chain of narration, free of anomalies or hidden defect. It may be elevated to Sahih status if supported by numerous chains of narrations, knows a "Sahih due to others".
   c. Da'if (Weak): narrations that do not meet the conditions of Sahih or Hasan. However, if supported by multiple chians of narration, it may be elevated to Hasan status know as "Hasan due to others".

Status as Evidence
- All categories except Da'if are considered evidences.
- Da'if narrations are not considered evidence, but may be mentioned as supporting evidence for establishing matters sourced form authentic means. 

** Modes of Narrating Hadith
Tahammul
Definition: Taking the narration from other.
Example: When a student listens to their teacher's narration.

Ada'
Definition: Propagating the narration to others.
Example: When a student narrates what they've learned from their teacher to another person

Formats of Ada'
1. Hadathani (He narrated to me): Used when the narrator's sheikh read the narration to them
2. Akhbaran (He informed me): Used when the narrator's sheikh either reads the narration to them or the narrator reads to their sheikh
3. Akbarani Ijazah or Ajaza I (He informed me with permission): Used when the narrator received permission (Ijazah) form their sheikh to narrate, even if they didn't read the narration.
4. Anana (From): used when the narrator narrates using the word "An" (from). The chain is considered connected unless the narrator is known for "Tadlis" (concealment), in which case it is not considered connected unless explicitly stated by the narrator.
   
Additional Notes
There are many types of hadith narrating in the field of Hadith science, but the above example cover the essential modes of narrating.
