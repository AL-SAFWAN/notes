#+title: The Foundation of the Knowledge of Usul
By [[id:1f3c2584-6f42-4867-97d9-d79905054018][Sheikh Muhammad ibn Saleh al Uthaymeen]] (d. 1421 AH) may Allah (ﷺ) have mercy on him.

For whosoever Allah guides none can misguide and whosoever he misguides none can guide, I bear witness that there is not true god but Allah alone with no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad is his slave and messenger, may Allah's peace and blessing be upon him, his family, his companions and those who follow them until the Day of Judgement. 

To proceed, I have authored a concise treatise on the principles of jurisprudence, tailored to align with the curriculum prescribed for third-year high school student at institutes of Islamic knowledge. I have titled this work "The foundations of the Knowledge of Usul"

I ask Allah to make our actions purely for his sake and beneficial to his Servants; He is always near and responsive.

This involves analysing the language of the text, discerning nuances such as the general from the specific, the conditional from the unconditional, and identifying instances of abrogation. Such skill are essential for a faqih to effectively interpret and implement the evidence in deriving coherent and applicable legal ruling from the foundational text of fiqh.

This definition specifically targets practical, observable behaviours rather than internal belief or convictions. Thus, within this scope, the term 'ruling' is applied only to those directives that influence physical or verbal actions, distinctly excluding matters purely of faith or belief, which do not fall under the category of 'rulings' in this specific juristic context.

 The [[id:a45f3047-54e8-405f-9166-40242b688ed9][Talifiyah]] are five; wajib (obligation), mandud (encouraged to understake), muharram (prohibited), makruh (disliked), and mubah (permissible).
**** 1. [[id:f2ed94ec-eb30-45bc-8b5a-b01a6169903f][Wajid]]
linguistically means what have fallen or what is compulsory.Technically, (the context of Islamic law) it signifies an act or duty that the legislator has mandated as obligatory. Example of such obligatory act include the five prayers

so in this case, when we say "what the legislator has ordered by way of obligation," we are specifically referring to actions that are mandatory (wajib).

This exclude:
Forbidden (Haram): (Actions that the legislator has explicitly prohibited).
Disliked (Makruh):(Actions that are discouraged but not sinful if performed)
Permissible (Mubah): (Actions that are neither required nor discouraged, and carry no reward of punishment)

Additionally, the statement 'by way of obligation' does not include actions that are Encouraged (Mandub) or Sunnah (which refer to acts that are recommended but not obligatory. Performing these actions brings reward, whereas neglecting them does not bring sin. This clarification is essential to differentiate between various levels of legal and moral responsibilities in Islamic law).

Therefore, something wajib is that which, if carried out, will bring reward to the one performing it, and the one fails to do so deserves to be punished.

It also referred to as Fard, faridah, hatam and lazim.

**** 2. [[id:cb994b3c-c1f8-4197-9dd0-5774b1ebc3dd][Mandub]]
linguistically means something or someone appointed or designated. Technically, it refers to what the legislator has recommended but not as an obligation, such as supererogatory prayers.

Therefore, excluded from out statement 'what the legislator has ordered' are actions that are forbidden, disliked, or merely permissible. Additionally, excluded from the phrase 'not by way of obligations' are actions that are wajib

Thus, when an actions is mandub, the performer is rewarded for carrying it out but is not punished for omitting it.

It is also known as Sunnah, mansnun, mustahab and nafal.

**** 3. [[id:3e653a3f-bd40-4551-b7fc-28c32b7ec903][Muharram]]
linguistically means forbidden, and technically, it refers to what the legislator has explicitly forbidden as an obligation to avoid, such as disobedience to the parents.

Therefore, excluding from our statement 'forbidden by the legislator' are actions categorised as wajib (obligation), mandud (recommended), mubah (permissible). Furthermore, excluded from the phrase 'an obligation to avoid' are actions that are merely disliked

Thus, when something is muharram (forbidden), the individual who refrains from it is rewarded, while one who engages in it deserve punishment.

This term is also referred to as Mahzur or mamnu.

**** 4. [[id:265dcc0d-0d72-4f6c-8819-85c4e27174f5][Makruh]]
linguistically means something hatred. Technically, it refers to what the legislator has discouraged but not by way of obligatory or abandon, such as taking and giving with the left hand.

Therefore, excluding from our statement "forbidden by the legislator" are actions categorised as wajib (obligatory), mandub (recommended), mubah (permissible). Also exclude from the phrase "not by way of obligation" is anything that is muharram (strictly forbidden).

Thus, when something is makruh, the individual who refines form it out of compliance with the legislation is rewarded, but one who performs the actions is not punished.

**** 5. [[id:fc1f0325-07ff-4d1e-977d-148511217a17][Mubah]]
linguistically means something declared or permitted. Technically, it refers to what is neither connected with a command nor prohibited in and of itself, like eating during the night of Ramadan.

Thus, excluded form our statement  'what is connected with a command' are actions that are wajib (obligatory) and mandub (recommended). Also excluded form our statement 'not something prohibited' are actions that are muharram (forbidden) and makruh (disliked). The phrase 'in and out itself' excluded anything that acts as a medium leading to a commanded actions, thus becoming obligatory, or leading to a forbidden actions, thus becoming prohibited, which would alter its original status as mubah (permissible). When something is categorised as mubah (permissible), it remains within the bounds of permissibility, not resulting in reward or punishment for engaging in it.

It is also refereed to as halal and ja'iz.

linguistically, means something free from defect or disease. Technically, it refer to the legitimacy and effectiveness resulting from and act of worship or a contract.
   
For acts of worship to be sahih (valid), they must meet all necessary conditions, pillars and obligatory steps; this ensures the fulfilment of religious responsibilities. For instance, performing prayer on time with completed purification and adhering to all it's requirements is essential for its validity.

Regarding contracts, sahih (valid) implies that the consequence of the contract directly depends on it existence and fulfilment of all legal requirement, such a in a sale contract, the property and the terms of sale must be clearly defined and greed upon. A contract cannot be considered valid unless it meets all essential condition and is free from any hindrances that might invalidate it.

Examples of conditions and impediments in worship include the invalidity of a prayer performed without proper purification. In contract, an invalid condition would be attempting to see something not owned by the seller. An example of an impediment in worship is performing supererogatory prayer at times specifically prohibited by religious guidelines. In contracts, an impediment would be executing a sale during the Friday prayer after the second call, when such transaction are considered inappropriate.

**** DONE 2. [[id:65b3754f-220d-41fb-b1eb-721c2df6eef0][Fasid]]

linguistically, means something that has been corrupted or is at a loss. Technically, it refers to action or contract that fail to produce their intended legal effect. Therefore, fasid (invalid) action of worship are those that do not fulfil the obligation required, resulting in an unmet religious demand, such as praying before the appointed time. Similarly fasid (invalid) contracts are those that are ineffective, like a contract to sell something unspecified or unknown.

All corrupt acts of worship, contracts and related condition are considered haram (forbidden); this is viewed as overstepping Allah's limits and mocking His verse, especially since the prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) forbade stipulating conditions that are not sanctioned by the Book of Allah.

While fasid (invalid) and batil (false) are generally synonymous, they differ distinctly in two specific scenario:

In Ihram: Fasid applies to violations by a person in Ihram, such as wearing stitched clothing or covering the head for males before the first restriction of Ihram are lifted. On the other hand batil (false) described more severs infractions, such as renouncing Islam while in Ihram

In Marriage: Fasid refers to conditions within a marriage that scholars have debated over, such as the validity of a marriage without a valid (guardian). batil, however, refers to conditions unanimously recognised as invalid, such as the marriage of a widow or a divorced woman during her waiting period, which is universally accepted as invalid.

(These distinctions highlight the specific legal consequence and religious implications associated with each term, reflecting the depth and complexity of Islamic jurisprudential terminology)

- excluded:
         - From out definitions, what is excluded from the phrase "the perception of something" is the incomplete or absent awareness of a face, which is termed *jahl basit* (simple ignorance). An example of this is when someone is asked, "When was the battle of badr" and responds, "I don't know".

         - Further excluded from our definition by the phrase "What it really is" is the misunderstanding or misperception of the reality, referred to as *jahl murakkab* (compounded ignorance). This occurs when a questions like "When was the battle of badr?" is answered with "in the third year after migrations,"which is incorrect as it actually took place in the second year after migration.

         - Lastly, what is also excluded form the phrase "firmly aware of it" it any tentative or *uncertain perception*, where the truth could potentially be different than perceived, such a state does not qualify as knowledge.

         - If one leans toward one interpretation over another uncertain one, this is termed *dhann (presumptions)* for more likely and waham (illusion) for the less likely, this state is refereed to as *shakk (doubt)*

** Definition
A statement which includes a request to avoid doing something by way of a high authority.
- requestion to  stop doing the action 
- The definition of a prohibition is a statement form a higher authority that includes a request to avoid doing something.
- excluded
    These expression convey a request to stop, their form is *that of a command* rather than a *prohibition*.


  - What is excluded from our definition is the inclusion of "gestures", as it's not typically regarded as a form of prohibition, even if it conveys a similar meaning. Additionally, excluded form out description of "a request to avoid something" is the concept of command, which entail a request to carry out an action rather than to avoid it. Furthermore, excluded from "from a higher authority" are appeals, supplications, or other forms of expression that do not imply prohibition.

  - Also excluded form our descriptions of 'a specific format of the presence tense, etc' are expression that indicate a request to abstain from something but are in the form of a command (al-amr), such as "da" (Leave alone), 'utruk'(leave, abandon), and 'kaff leave off, among other.
    

*** Forms of prohibitions
- It typical follows a specific format, using the present tense couple with the "laam" of prohibition such as the statement of the Most High":
  - "Do not follow those who deny Our revelation and who do not believe in the Hereafter" 6:150
  - The lām alift of prohibition connected to the verb
    - the verb is to show what not to do
      - e.g don't come close to the wealth of the orphan
        - don't come close to zina 
- Other (contextual forms).
  - furthermore, prohibition can be conveyed through means other than the normal forms of prohibition,
    - such as when the act is described as haram, severely warned against,
    -  distasteful or when the perpetrator is disparaged, or when a punishment is ascribed to it, and so forth.
    - the ahkam taklifiyah
      - using the word muharam
          e.g hurimat aliakum
        - not halal for you
        - connect a punishment to an action
          - e.g. punishment of theose to take the wealth of the orphan
        - e.g stay away from action
          - these are like comands

** What the wording of prohibition necessitates
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d2a92f4c-5a61-4bc9-998b-05c5bbe80b9b
:END:
*** 1. The default position of all prohibitions is that they necessitate taḥrīm
   (forbidden).
   - untill it can be proven otherwise
     - e.g it's haram to murder to the polytheist
     - if they say it's dislike, then they need ot prove it
       
     - *When left unrestricted,prohibitions necessitates the complete forbiddance* of the action in question and render it *invalid*.

     - This is supported by evidence such as the statement of the Most High:
       - "And whatever the Messenger give you then take it, and whatever he forbids you form then abstain from it" 59:7

     - So, the command is to cease what he has forbidden us from, *necessitating our abstention from it*, thus rendering it a prohibited act.
       - From the evidence that demonstrates the invalidity of certain actions is the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ): "whoever does an action that is not in accordance with our affair , then it is rejected", meaning it is reject if it goes against his teachings.
*** 2. Actions must be avoided right away.
   - logically once you have engaged it then you have acted on the prohibtion
     - hence you need to do it right away
*** 3. Continuously avoiding the actions.
   - prohibition need to continuously as appose to the command
     - because it my harm you in this dunya and the akhira
     - hence you keep avoiding it until death   
*** 4. The command of the opposite.
   - you must do the other stuff against it, the opposite
     - don't sit, so you should be stand

*** 5. Invalidity of the action if the prohibition returns to “the very thing itself being prohibited”.
       - they differe on this
         - 30 different view
    -e.g we was forbad to fast on a certain days, and he the fast on the day of eid, he did something haram, but is it still valid or not?
     - does a Prohibition nessectates the invalidity of an action

 
The principle according to the *Hanbali school* of thought concerning those things that have been forbidden, wheather they are *correct or not* is as follows:

**** * 1. 
النهي ::
.  ان يكون النهي عائدا ذات المنهي عنه ::
  The prohibition returns back to the very action itself being prohibited.
  - e.g the fasting itself on eid is haram
    - this is specificlly prohibited
  - The prohibition returns back to the very thing itself being prohibited or its conditions, thus making it invalid.
    - An example of the 1. principle in worship is the prohibition on fasting on the two days of Eid.
    - an Example of the 1. principle in dealing with other people is the prohibition of selling after the second call of prayer for whoever is obligated to observe Friday.
      - majority agree with 1
****  2.      
  (ان يكون النهي عائدا إلى شرط المنهي عنه :)   
  The prohibition returns back to one of the conditions of the prohibited action.
  - wearing silk clothes to cover the awnrah
    - covering the awrah is a condition of the salah
      - he done something haram by wearing silk, and carried it over on the condition
      - The prohibition returns back to something other than itself or its conditions, therefore not being valid.
        - An example of the 2. principle is the prohibition of a man wearing silk. although covering his 'awrah fulfils one of the condition of prayer, if he covers it with a fordden cloth, such as silk, *his prayer is invalid* because of the prohibition *return to the condition required for the prayer to be valid (e.g. the internal condition of the prayer itself)*.

          - An example of the 2. in transaction is the prohibition on the sale of foetus. Knowledge of what one is buying is a condition for the validity of the transaction. if a foetus is sold, *the transaction is not valid* due to the condition of the prohibition.
          - accord to imaan ahmed
          - anyone that does these two codtion (1 and 2) about, the action is invaldiated
            - disagree with point 2 on the habali madhab, by the majory (+ the sencond option with the hanabli madhab + the author)
              - they are two separate prohibition and they're not linked
                - the action itself is valid, but the thing he did is haram and he will be accountable
                  - this seems to be the correct view
                  - - the actio is valid

 
****  3. 
 ان يكون النهي عائدا إلى أمر خارج ال يتعلق بذات المنهي عنه وال شرطه ::
   The prohibition returns back to something other than the specific prohibited action or its conditions.
   - majority agreed
      - if he wear silk hat and socks, his salah is valid
        - the things that he did is not a condition nor return to the action itself
          - hence the action is valid
        
        - An example of a prohibition return to an *external issue in worship* is wearing of a silk turban by a man. If he prays while wearing a silk turban, it does not invalidate his prayer because the prohibition does not related directly to the prayer or it's condition for acceptance.

        - An example of a prohibition returning to an *external issue in transactions* is the prohibition of fraud if something is sold fraudulently, that does not invalidate the sale itself.

** Other meanings of prohibitions
The default is Haram however, With the presence of an external indicator (qarīnah), or via the context of
a verse, a prohibition may also mean:
**** 1. Dislike (makruh)
- المكروه :: Disliked
- For instance, the Prophet (ﷺ) advised against using the right hand to touch one's private part while urinating, state, "Do not let any of you touch his private part with his right hand when he urinates."
  - Scholars suggest that the prohibition her signifies dislike, as the private part is part of the body, and refraining from using the right hand aims to maintain its purity.
- drinking while standing is prohibited (an nahar), if this was the only hadith then it would have been haram, but ibm abas saw that he drank standing up, so it meand it not haram but to disklike
  - its not possible for the prophet to do something haram
    - in legislation, execpt that Allah will inform us
      - do that mean the prophet (ﷺ) do makrh,  no
        since he follow the orders of Allah to show that it's disliked to us
        people in gereal at the time of the sahaba used to think it was haram, the prophet (ﷺ) stated up to show it's not

        - toching the private is haram, but there are another narration to show that it apart of your body
          - so it shows that its makruh, going from haram -> makruh 
**** 2. Guidance
- اإلرشاد :: General guidance/advice
- . Another example is the Prophet's instruction to Muadh ibn Jabal, advising him to regularly supplicate after every prayer "O Allah, help me to remember You, give thanks to You, and worship You well",
  - Although not explicitly obligatory, this guidance highlights the importance of continual remembrance, gratitude and devotion to Allah.
    
- a father telling his son don't do this, so the child understand it is an addvice
  - eg. don't ask exreme question that will make it difficutl for you, e.g when they asked the ruling of hajj
 
    - he hold the had of muadh
      - he said i'm here la baik
        - he look to him and said i love you (another narration x3)
        - and he said by Allah i love you to
          - the then prophet said the statement of the end of the salah
            - it came in "say" form
            - or don't leave these statement execept you "say" alluma ala dikri husni ibadah
          - it's dislike to leave and and recommended to do (agreed upon)
            - concus show that
              - the context of hadith show us
                - the correct palse can before the taslim or after it
 
**** 3. contempt/disjust
- التحقير :: Contempt/disgust
E.g the peole who follow the dunya
- don't extend your eye, this is a comtempt type prohibtion, they just look for the gold of this world and chase and chase it

*** Indicators to adjust the default positions of a command and prohibition 
1. The Qur’an
   - state in the quran to give light to it and explain to us that Allah does not want this
     - for the al-amr
     . e.g. people who pass away from the poor people
     - provide for them, with the money of you're inheritance
       - Allah abrogate this 
         - shabha explain there nolonger to desreve this 
         - to mandud or
           - to keep ties with them, according to imaan shaafi 
         - mubah
           - 3 other madhabs
     - for an nathir 
       - when a person make something abolitory upon himslef when it not as an oath
         - in the quran it indicate it as good and a description of the good people something like that need to check
           - so it goes from haram -> dislike
            
2. The statements of the Prophet ﷺ
   - pray the witr prayer in command before sleeping or fajr, hence it shows wajib
     - other narration changes this
       - a man came to the prophet (ﷺ) and asked what is make obligatory of salah
         - it says the 5 prayer made day and night
           - and he ask is there naything else upon me
             - he said no , except if you do it optionally
               - hence no longer fard -> reccomeded madud

3. The actions of the Prophet ﷺ
   - wearing the white thobe is more purifying and better, the way it said is obligatory
     - however in another haidth
       - he wore two green garment,
         - it move from obligatory -> mubah
   - an nathir
     e.g drinking sanding up     
4. Commandments and prohibitions in (etiquettes and manners)
   - differed on this
     - as it's related to the matters of the dunya, so they treat the default a disliked
       - e.g al qazaa, cut half ot the hair and leave the other part
         - leave it all or shave it all
           - ibm qayyim quotes makrooh and not haram
         - eating with the left should be haram
           - but the vast majority say it's makrooh
             becasue it comes in the chapter of  etiquettes and manners
5. When a command/prohibition applies in one situation but not in another
   - non of you should fast on the friday, excep the day before it or after, but not on the day itse'f
     - the usul of these type of prohibition
       - the deafult is dislike but not haram
         - the external indication (qiranah) is that fact that it came with a situation that allowed it
           
    - antoher example is to fast of asurah
     - fast it the day before and after
      
6. Consensus of the scholars of Islam (*ijmāʿ*)
   - the shabhba they understood it the best
   - The prohibiton would have indicated ḥarām by default, but because of consensus/majority practice and context, we interpret it as makrūh 
     - So ijmāʿ is a qarīnah that changes the level of the ruling.

                and the child is the reason due to it
      
why is islam not a contion in takilify
- the kafir will be punished for salah and all of the action that allah prohibited

  - even if they prayer, there good deed/action won't be accepted
    - becasue  islam is a condition for the acceptance of the action, but not a condition for accountablity/ talifiyka 

the insane
 - for the person who is insane he is not accoutnable for him in the duyah and the akhira
   - as for ibadah action
     - allah did not request it or required it
     - there is not conquece for it in the dunya and akhira
       - however if he harmed a peron or damaged a proverty or steal
         - he's not accountable in the dunya
           - but he and his gardian are requided to fix the problem
       - even  if he a sane person breaks something in sleep then it counts, because he is still accountable in the dunya

              - you hit them  (i.e you don't harm) someone except that you left something obligatory
                - reason, becasue it take time to get the habit of salah
                  - from 7 and more so from 10
                    - are the action accepted from here and who get the reward

- Accountability for Commandments and Prohibitons include Muslim and Non-Muslim
  - Both groups are obligated to obey the commands and refrain from the prohibitions. However the acceptance of deed differs between Muslim and non-Muslim.
    - None-Muslims have their deed accepted even while they remain in a state of disbelief, as mention in the Qur'an:
      - "What prevents their expenditures from being accepted form them but that they have disbelieved in Allah and his Messenger" 9:54
        - Non-Muslims are not required to make up for their past deed if they accept Islam, as indicated in another verse:
          - "Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previous occurred will be forgiven for them" 8:38
            - Additionally, the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) informed Amr ibn al-as that "Islam nullifies previous actions." Therefore, a person is only punished if they die in a state of disbelief. This is evident from the quranic verse describing the response of the wrongdoers when question about their deeds.
              - "What put you into Saqar? They will say, We were not of those who prayed, not did we used to feed the poor, and we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged [in it], and we used to deny the Day of recompense until there came to us the certainty" 74:42-47


*** شروط الصحة – Conditions of Validity
- These are the conditions for the *validity* of an act of worship, transaction, or other legal act.
- The *mukallaf* must fulfil them for the act to be sound in the sight of Sharī‘ah.
- If these conditions are not met, the act is *invalid* and will not be accepted.
  - islam is a condition for valditiy
    - so theire carity won't be accepted
      simialar, reacting the age of maturity, the action is accept but not obligaotry
      - why usool scholars mention this 
        - e.g kafir should be fasting during ramanadam, so we will faslitating in haram
          - there are 24 different opions
            iman ahmed
            - both are held accoutable
        - deal with muslim on the deafult position so you don't need to ask. 

*** شروط الوجوب – Conditions of Obligation
- These are the conditions for an act to *become obligatory* upon the *mukallaf*.
- When these conditions are fulfilled, the person is required to perform the act.
- If they are not fulfilled, the act may not yet be obligatory (e.g 7-10yr) (even if performing it would still be valid).

Mawani’ al-Taklif are the obstacles to legal accountability in Usul al-Fiqh.
- These are factors that prevent a person from being held blameworthy, even if they meet a sign of maturity and accountability when these obstilbes are present.


There are circumstances that exempt individual from he obligations set by the shariah
1. Ignorance, forgetfulness, and coercion, The prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) stated: "Allah has forgiven my ummah for its mistakes; what they forget and they are forced to do". This hadith narrated by ibn Majah and al Bayhaqi and is supported by corroborating evidence form the Quran and Sunnah. If a person violates a prohibitions unknowingly, they bear no sin. For example, someone speaking during prayer without knowledge of the prohibition against it. Similarly, if one neglected and obligation without realising it necessity, they are not required to make up for it once the time has passed. An example is when the Prophet (ﷺ) did not instruct a person who prayed incorrectly, lacking tranquillity, to compensate for missed prayer. Instead, he direct them to perform the current prayer correctly.
   - e.g saying something in sleep
     - but if he breaks something in sleep then it counts
       
2. Forgetfullness refer to the absence of mind regarding something known. If someone unintentionally commits a prohibited act due to forgetfulness, there is no sin upon them. An example is someone eating while fasting because they forgot they were fasting. Similarly, if a duty is forgetten, there is no obligation while in a state of forgetfulness. However, once a remembered, the duty must be fulfilled. This is supported by the saying of the Prophet Muhammed (ﷺ: "Whoever forgets the prayer, let him pray when he remembers"
   - he will not be punished for his action
     - Allah will have mercy for him
       - eg fasting and breaks his food
         - his fast is not broken
           
3. Coercion entails forcing someone to do something against their will. If someone is compelled to engage in a forbidden act, there is no sin upon them, such as being coerced into acts of disbelieved while maintaining faith in their heart. Similarly, if someone is compelled to neglect an obligation, there is no sin while under coercion, and they must fulfil it once the coercion ceases. For instance, if someone is coerced to miss a prayer until after its allotted time, they must make it up as soon as possible once the coercion ends.
   - being forced
     - you can't bear, it i.e to the point of commit suicide 
     - you can bear it, you can still be accountable, just going to prison
         
When these are present, a person may not be held responsible for leaving an obligation or committing a prohibition.
These allowance are based on Allah's forgiveness and mercy concerning His rights. However regarding the rights of others, commitments must be honred unless the involved party choose to overlook them.
** Important principles for prohibitions in uṣūl al-fiqh

*** Principle 1
النهي يدل على التحريم ::
Prohibitions indicate impermissibility.

*** Principle 2
األصل في النهي التحريم حتى تأتي قرينة تصرفه إلى الكراهة ::
The default rule regarding prohibitions is impermissibility unless
there is evidence that redirects it to dislike.
- the evidence is 6 types the above we just did
*** Principle 3
النهي المطلق للفور والدوام ::
An absolute prohibition implies immediate and continuous avoidance.

*** Principle 4
النهي يدل على الفساد ::
A prohibition necessitates the invalidity of the action.
*** Principle 5
ما ال يتم الحرام اال به فهو حرام ::
Whatever is necessary to complete a prohibition is itself prohibited.

The term Al-'Am
linguistically
signifies inclusively.

Technically,
it refers to an all-encompassing word that incorporates all its individual elements without restriction:

- “An all-encompassing word that includes all its individual elements without restriction.”
  
- Or: “A word (or name) that encompasses everything it applies to, in a single usage, without limitation.”
  
such as:
"The righteous are in bliss" 82:13, 84:22

  - e.g when you entering a masjid, you can sit down and till you perform 2 rakat, this is said in a general term.
    e.g. there is no nikah wihtout witness, so it doesn't matter if she is a virgin or not or divorced or not, it dones't matter becasue it's general
    - so it not for particlar parties
  - all the water from the sky is pure
    - e.g rain, snow

- the law is general and allowed in different circumstances
  
- exlcude: 
  - What is excluded from our phrase "includes all its individual elements" is anything that pertains only to single elements, like a specific noun or an indefinite article in an affirmative context. For example, the verse:
    - "The freeing of a neck" 58:3
    - it does not encompass all elements inclusively but focuses on one unspecified element.
    - And what it not covered by the phrase "without restriction" is anything that addresses all its elements with restrictions, such as specific number like "one hundred thousand" and similar expressions.

- A noun made definite via possession/annexation (*X of Y*), whether singular or plural, can indicate generality in the possessed group.
  - something that (denfinate) is know
    - is owned by something (posseive conjuectio) in sentence
    - you will not able to count all of the blessing of Allah, even if you sit an count
     -  blessing of Allah, this is connected, hence the blessing here is refered to all of the blessig
       - blessing is a noun
- the wife of the prohet, you're not like any of the type of women
  - in the same form, all of you child are deserving of youre inherance
    - you own you children 
    
6. The possession (noun) singular or plural, defined thought Al-idhafah (a possessive noun) - like the saying of the Most High:
   "mention the grace of Allah upon you" 3:103

*** 7. Definite noun with the inclusive “al-” (المعرف بالألف واللام الاستغراقية)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       957d28a8-dff9-4092-934a-f7ad208443a0
:END:
- A generic noun defined with *al-* (ال) of total inclusion (الاستغراق) indicates generality, e.g. *الناس، المؤمنون*.
- he created all of mankind weak
  - al insan here is all of mankind, everyonek

   "And when the children among you came of age, let also ask permission of those before them" 24:59

   in the context of defined nouns acknowledge by the 'al' article, their definition depends on the extent of acknowledgement. If the acknowledgement is general, then the noun is considered defined in general terms. Conversely, if the acknowledgement is specific, then the noun is regarded as defined in specific terms.

An example of a general acknowledgement is found in the verse:
"The lord said to the angels, I create man from clay. When I have breathed into him of my spirit and fashioned him, they prostrated to him. all the angels, every last one of them, fell done in prostraction" 38:71-47
   
An example of specific is the saying of the Most High:
o"As we sent a messenger to Pharaoh, so Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so we took hold of him in a severe way" 73:15-16
When the "al" article defines a class noun, it doesn't render singular nouns as general. For instance, when saying "The man is better than the women" or "the men are better than the women" it doesn't imply that every individual man is better than every individual women, Rather, it suggest that the male gender as a whole is considered superior to the female gender, even though theere may be  individual women who surpass certain men in certain aspects.

:END:
What do general terms necessitate?
*** It is *obligatory* to act according to the general wording.
It's imperative to adhere to the general implication of text until evidence suggest specificity. This is because the Quranic and Sunnah text require adherence to their general meaning until evidence indicate otherwise.

- There is *no requirement* to search for an evidence that specifies it *before* acting upon it.
  - these are general statement in text

When we encounter a general statement stemming form a particular circumstance, we should still abide by its general implication .
- This focus is on the generality of the wording rather than the specific reason behind it, unless evidence specifically points to its particular application.
  - For instance , consider the case of zihar
    - a form of divorce where a man compares his wife to a relative.
      - While it originated from a
        - specific incident involving a companion,
          - the ruling applies generally to anyone in a similar situation.
  - An instance where evidence specifies a general statement is found in the Prophet (ﷺ) saying:
    - "it is not from righteousness to fast while travelling".
      - The context behind this statement involves
        - the Prophet encountering a man during a journey.
          - The Prophet (ﷺ) was on a journey whereupon he saw a crowd and a man being shaded by them and said What is this,
            - They said, he is fasting, he said, it is not from righteousness to fast while travelling.
              - Uponthis observation, he remarked that fasting while travelling is not a righteous act.
                - This generality becomes specific to those who share the circumstance of the man in question
                  - specifically, when fasting becomes burdensome during travel.

The specificity of this ruling is evident from the Prophet own practice. He would fast during journey when it wasn't arduous for him, highlighting that he abstain from actions deemed unrighteous.

"Singling out specific elements from a general term."
-Allah lifts the rule of a general term for:
   - a group
   - a person
   - a number of occurrences
   - what does this mean
     - a new rule is made for these peole
       - this is kalled at-taksis
   - every male child is given twice to a female childe
     - where are the exception
       - fatima tried to cliam the gardent
         - she did not know about the inhertance
           - and was taken by the mustlim
             - since the specfic
       - killing the parents for inhrance
       - muslim getting his inhertance from kafir
   linguistically represents the exact opposite of generalisation. Technically, it signifies singling out specific elements form what is general.

  - An "Al-mukhasis" with an I - is the individual responsible for making things specific or customised (takhsis). This role is typically held by the legislator, and the evidence supporting taksis is also referred to using this term (mukhasis)

:END:

1. *Connected* (المتصل – al-Mukhassas al-Muttasil)
   - connected to the sentence
   - Connecting, referring to what cannot stand independently
 - connected specified
  - Therefore, one form of the connected specified, know as "" is the "Al-istithnah (exception)".
    
    - Linguistically, "Al-istihnah" derives form "thana", which means to bend something with another part of itself, akin to tying a rope.

    - Technically, it involves extracting specific elements from the general using the word "illa"(except) or its equivalent, as seen in the Quranic verse:

    - "indeed man is in loss except those who believe and do good work, and exhort one another to truth and exhort one another to patience" 103: 2-3

      - Excluded from this definition are methods of specifying something with a conditions or any other means beside "illa" or its equivalents.
Occurs *within the same sentence or context.*

:END:


Example (Qur’an):
- {من كفر بالله من بعد إيمانه إلا من أكره...}
   - used in the same sentence

Example (Sunnah):
- “Its trees shall not be cut *except* idhkhir grass.”
 - all tree the exception is idkhir gress (used for roofing)  
 
********* 2. Sifah – Descriptive Attribute
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bcdfaca2-e861-42cf-a0fa-d436a04918e3
:END:
among the connected specifiers is a description,
 which involves specifying certain individuals from a general group using an adjective,
   - substitute (badl), or state (hal).
     - And example of this is found in the Qur'an verse:
       - "From those whom your right hand possess of believing slave girls" 4:25

     - The example of substitute in the saying of the Most High:
       - "And due to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage for the House - for whoever is able to find there to away" 3:97

     - And example of a state (hal) is the saying of the Most High:
     - "But whoever kill ad believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah as become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared him a great punishment" 4:93


Example:
- Marriage to believing slave women (4:25)
  - if you are too poor then marry a muslim slave
    - the slave is described as a muslim
      - not any
        - hence it is restricted
          
- Zakat on “freely grazing” sheep
  - if you thought of all the sheep the type
    - but is has been described with restriction on the freely grazing 
    - e.g the tired ones stand up 
********* 3. Shart – Condition
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       211d78ca-172b-492a-bad9-93cfd596aa11
:END:
  
 among the connected specified is the "shart" conditions,
which in Arabic refers to a mark or sign. Here, it denotes connecting one thing to another, wether it is present or not, using the conditional "An" or one of it equivalents

The conditions is specific, whether it appears early or late in the text. An example of its early appearance is found in Allah's statement regarding the idolaters:
 - "But if they should, repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them go on their way. Indeed Allah is fogiving and merciful" 9:5
   - *if* they repent

- And an example of when it is delayed in the text is the saying of the Most High:
- "And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] form among who you right hand possess - then make a contract which them if you know there is within them goodness" 24:33
  - here again "if"


Example:
- Husband inherits half *if* she has no children (4:12)
  - was spereate by a condtion
--
- e.g the worst peole became the best peple
  - if they learn
- these are found within the same statnece

:END:
2. *Separate* (المنفصل – al-Mukhassas al-Munfasil)
   - Separate, referring to what can exist independently
   - not wihtint the same sentence, but sepcified else where
 
al-Mukhassas al-Munfasil — Separate Specifier
The restricting evidence comes from *another text*, not the same sentence.

Sources:
-----

The separate specifier is independent and consist of three elements:
- sense,
- reason and
- legislation

An example of specification by sense is found in the quran verse about the wind of 'Ad:
"Destroy everything by command of its' lord" 46:25

Here, the sense indicate that the wind did not destroy the heaven and the earth, and
  - general terms that intended specifics words
    - it didn't break everything i.e the sky
      - so you sense tell you that it not meant in the genreal terms



example of taksis through reason is the saying of the Most High:
"Allah is the Creator of All things" 39:62

- The mind indicates that Allah is not created.
- Some of the scholars hold the view that what is made specific by the sense and intellect is not from the general that is made specific, rather it is from the general which is inteded for being specific, so the intent of the speaker or the addressee is not the specific in the first place, and is a general reality which a specific one (as the saying of the Most High) is intended by.
  - general terms that are specific in its term or nature
  - e.g. coat made out of the sin of pigs
    - 7 different opions
      - any type of skin of any that is tann becomes pure
        - any type here they say, is what we know logiaclly its not going to be pig
          - form it's general sense
      - or it becomes pure due to the tanning i.e  the reason is tanning
  
As for takhsis of legislation,
- then the Book and the Sunnah is made specific by each other as well as by Ijma and analogy.

Definition:  
"A word that is neither qualified nor conditioned nor limited, and indicates a reality without restriction."

Example:  
- أعتق رقبة — *free a slave*  
  → No type, condition, or description is specified.

  - al insan, all of mankind, from the man kind is the slave
    - a general element form the general term
      - hasn't been condition, restricted or qualify to something specific

The definition of Absolute (al-mutlaq):
- Al-mutlaq
  - linguistically
    - means the opposite of unrestricted, and
  - technically it means: whatever indicates a reality without a restriction as the saying of the Most High:
    - "The freeing of a slave before they touch one another " 58:3
  - What is excluded from our words:
    - "Whatever indicates a reality" is the general (al-Am)
      - because it indicates the generality of something whereas the Absolute indicate the absolute nature of a particular reality.
        - And what is also excluded

The definition of Restricted (Al-muqayyid):

Scholars determine:
- Does the Muqayyad restrict the Mutlaq?
- Or are they independent because the contexts differ?
This reconciliation preserves precision and consistency in fiqh.
They help scholars:
- analyse different evidences,
- reconcile unrestricted vs restricted wordings,
- extract precise legal rulings. can we do this?

e.g surah baqrah
The Cow (2:67) 

- And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, Allāh commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Do you take us in ridicule?" He said, "I seek refuge in Allāh from being among the ignorant."
  - They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is." [Moses] said, "[Allāh] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded."
    - They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color." He said, "He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.'.
      - They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allāh wills, will be guided.
        - He said, "He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.'" They said, "Now you have come with the truth." So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it."

https://quran.com/2/67
- the cow is a cow
  - they could have choosen any cow and they would have fulfilled the camandment
  - then they asked again
    - it's been resricted more with color and age 
- hence if you find it in the quran and sunnah, you follow the example of musa
  - e.g it haram to drink blood
    - rear steak - we find some blood
      - but it has been restricted, the type of blood
        - the blood which gushes out when you slaughter the animal
          - we get the 1) mutlaq and apply the 2) muqayyad to it
            - get the restrict and aplly it to the unristricted to it

This explains **when** the Muqayyad restricts the Mutlaq and when it **does not**.

Scholars agree:

- Sometimes it is invalid.

:END:
If both texts share:
- the same ruling,
- the same cause,

→ The restricted (muqayyad) qualifies the unrestricted (mutlaq).

Example:  
Prohibition of *blood*.
- of consuming the blood
  - to prevent it from settling one stomach to prevent harm (reason)
    
the Prohibition is unriststed
but it another verse it is restircted

Mutlaq:  
{حُرِّمَت عليكم … والدم} (5:3)
Prohibition of *blood*.
- of consuming the blood
  - to prevent it from settling one stomach to prevent harm (reason)
    
Muqayyad:  
{أو دماً مسفوحاً} — *spilled/flowing blood* (6:145)


Conclusion:
they have the same ruling and same hukum 
→ The restricted (muqayyad) qualifies the unrestricted (mutlaq).
 - Only *flowing blood* is prohibited.
andother example, milk mothers
- was mention in a unrestrict  form
  - anyone that is feed
    - it was initally 10 feeds, then to 5 feeds
 - there both talking about milk and mahram
   - hence you apply the 5 feed to this ayah
   - so you overall ruling has resticting
     - it's basicling like an expalingiton of the ayah from the sunnah

:END:
If:
- the rulings differ,
- the reasons differ,

→ They cannot affect one another.

Example:
1. Cutting the hand of the thief — different hukm/sabab
   - cuting hand - ruling - let unrestrict
   - theif - reason
2. Washing hands for wudu — different hukm/sabab
   - wudo (washing hand to elbow)  - is restricted
   - for salah - reason 

Therefore:  
No cross-restriction.
in the first there are narration for it

another example
kill acidence - reason
fast 2 monst 

expication for breaking oath 
fast 3 days - unresicted
No cross-restriction.
- However,
  - if they pertain to *different* matters for differert reason,
    - both text are followed,
      - with the /restriction/ of
        - one an the ~absoluteness~ of the
          - other taken into account.
            -  An example for when the ruling is for *different issues* is the saying of the Most High:
              - "as for the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands" 5:38
              - And his saying in the verse regarding ablution:
                - "Wash you're faces and your forarms to the elbows" 5:6
              - Here although the ruling may seem similar, there is a difference, the first verse mention cutting, while the second mentions washing.
                - Therefore, we do not qualify the first text by the second: the first verse remains absolute, specifying that the cutting should be from the wrist.
                  - Similarly, the second verse remain restricted, indicating that the washing should be done up to and including the elbows.

:END:
If:
- rulings differ,
- reason is the same,

→ Mutlaq generally remains unrestricted.

Example:
1. Wudu: wash hands to elbows (restricted)  
2. Tayammum: wipe hands (unrestricted)

Reason in both: *purification*  (for salah)
But rulings differ (1 is resitricted and 2 is unrestrict) → hence no restriction is applied.
e.g the shafee and vast mojority
- it is not permissble to unrestrict it
***** 4. = Hukm and ≠ Sabab, → Disagreement; majority restrict
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       32e92b11-5c9f-4554-b193-649f8c74f999
:END:
If:
- rulings are the same,
- reasons differ,

→ Majority: the Muqayyad restricts the Mutlaq.

Example:
1. Zihār expiation — free *a slave* (mutlaq)
2. Killing expiation — free *a believing slave* (muqayyad)

Majority:
- rulings are the same (to free a slave)
  - but has been restricted in killing to be a believing slave
The unrestricted becomes restricted unless evidence shows independence.

- however the reasons differ (zihar vs accident killing),

  - so can we apply the restirct of a "believing" slave to the one who want to go back to his wife
    - should he free any slave
      -  if they share the same ruling
        - then you can and it is olgatory
          - majority
    - or a believing slave
      - hanifa and (other in there riwayah of the imaan of  madhab agree with abu hanifa) 
        - the reason are differnt so why would we restrict them
          - response - Allah doesn't make reason for ibadaat like else where
    - this is a reason for majority for difference in opionion
      
When an ~absolute~ (al-mutlaq) text and a /restricted/ (Al-muqayyid) on address
- the *same issue*, hukm, but different reason
  - the /restricted/ is applied to the absolute text.
    - An example of when the issue of *both text* is addressing *one issue*, but have differnt reasons
      - is the saying of the Most High in expiation of zihar
        - (pronouncing one's wife as the back of his mother intended by it divorce):
          - 1st verse -> "The freeing of a *slave* before they touch one another" 58:3
        - And his saying about the expiation for murder:
          - 2nd verse"Freeing a /believing/ *slave*"  4:92
      - The ruling remains consistent:
        - the freeing of a slave, therefore
          - we must qualify the absolute nature of the first verse
          - expiation of *zihar* by restricting it to the *freeing of a* /believing/ *slave*,
            - which aligns with the restriction specified in the verse regarding the expiation for *murder* consequently,
              - in both cases,
                - the *slave being freed* should be a /believer/.

**** Definition
The Definition of  Obscure (Al-mujmal)
- Obscure linguistically
  - denotes something vague or accumulated.
- Technically,
  - it refer to what cannot be understood without futher specification, clarification of its description or determination of it quantity.
    - And 
/Mujmal/ is:
- “That which indicates *one of multiple meanings*, with *no preference* for
  any of them in relation to the context.”
  
  - not clear which they indicate so you don't know how to apply it
    - widom is to test the people to see if they follow them or not
      - e.g nikhah
              after 3 divorce ( you can't come to back it ) 
              1 mean - marriage with nikkah
              2 mean - marraige with constumation
        - in the sunnah we now it mean consumation
          - e.g. people will say no but in the quran it say this and that and interpreted wrong
            - so Allah test them to see what they view
Examples:  
      - example of what needs something to specify it is the saying of the Most High:
        - "Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods"2:228
        - The term "al-qar" is ambiguous, encompassing both menstruation and purity. Therefore,
          - clarification is needed from evidence to determine which meaning is intended in given context.
        - An example of what needs something else explaining it's description is the saying of the Most High:
          - "And establish the prayer" 2:43
            - Indeed establishing the prayer is unknown and
              - needs to be explained.
        - An example of what needs something else explaining its amount is the saying of the Most High:
          - "And pay Zakat" 2:43
            - Similarly, the specific amount of Zakat that must be paid is not specified
              - in this verse and require clarification for other source.

     meanings*.
   - Example:
     - In the verse about waiting periods:  
       =ثَلَاثَةَ قُرُوءٍ=  
       The word *qurūʾ* may mean:
       - *menstrual cycles* (ḥayḍ), or
       - *periods of purity* (ṭuhr).
     - Both are valid literal meanings.

   - At times, an action of the Prophet ﷺ may carry *two possible meanings*.
   - The action remains ambiguous until evidence clarifies which meaning is
     intended.
     - when one break the fast to make kafara for 60 days
       - so someone broken their fast during ramandan
         - so does this mean the same hadith applies here
           - this kafara means relations with ones wife, not brekaing by food or other stuff

   - None of these figurative meanings are to be preferred without evidence.
   - Example:
     - The ḥadīth:  
       “There is no prayer without the opening of the Book.” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim)
       - “Opening of the Book” is figuratively understood as *reciting
         al-Fātiḥah*.

**** Ruling
- The ruling regarding *mujmal* text is to *wait for external clarification* i.e the bayan.
- It is *not permissible* to act upon any of its possible meanings *without
  proof*, because:
  - the word itself does not give clear guidance on the intended meaning,
  - and it is not permissible to impose obligations without evidence.

*** Ruling

- The Mukallaf (responsible individual) must act upon the Mujmal when its explanation becomes clear to him.
  - The prophet (ﷺ) elucidate all aspects of legislation, its principles, and subsidiary matters to his followers.
    - He left behind a clear and unambiguous path for his nation, with its night resembling its day, without leaving any ambiguity unresolved.
      - The Prophet's explanations were convey either
        - orally, thought his
        - actions or through a combination of
        - both.
          - For instant he orally specified the amount and set the limit of Zakat, such as his statement: "A tenth of whatever is watered by the sky", which clarifies the general directive of the verse
        - "And pay the Zakat" 2:43
          - An example of him explaining through action is establishing the ritual of Hajj in front of all his followers making clear the generality of the saying forthe Most High:
            - "And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way" 3:97
- indeed, the Prophet's practical explanation were profound.
  - For instance, his observance of the eclipse prayer according to its prescribed manner served as a practical elucidation of his statement: "if you see any of it then pray".
    - Similarly, his combination of words and prayer,
      - as narrated in the account of the man who prayer incorrectly where he said, "If you go to prayer, complete the ablution properly, then face the Qiblah and say Allah hu Akbar". until the rest of the narration.
        
- Moreover, his action alone also served as instructive demonstration.
  - For instance, in the narrations of Sahl Ibn Sa'd as Sadi, the prophet (ﷺ) led the prayer from the pulpit, initiating with "Allahu akbar", and the congregation followed suit. Subsequently, then turned to them and elucidated, "I have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayer"

**** Definition
/Mutashābih/ refers to:
- That which has an unclear meaning, where:
  - the intended meaning is *not apparent*,
  - and *Allah alone* knows its true interpretation,
  - and He has *not revealed* it to any of His creation.

It is used for matters where there is *no hope of knowing* the intended
meaning for those who find it ambiguous.

**** Example
- The *nature of the attributes of Allah*:
  - the face of Allah
    - we believe it, but its realidy we don't know
      - the shair'a tell us not to ask how
        - to ask how is bidah, e.ge what imaam malik said
  - We understand the *essence* of the attribute (e.g. knowledge, power),
  - but the *specific manner / how* of these attributes remains unknown and
    ambiguous to us.

  - to have *īmān* in what Allah and His Messenger ﷺ intended by them,
  - and to *refrain* from pursuing their exact detailed meaning,
  - because knowing their precise reality is *impossible* for us.
    - The Mu'atilah (deviant sect) regarding the saying of the Most High: "The Most Merciful rose above the throne".
    - [They changed the meaning of istawa (rose)] to meaning of "istawlah" to conquer, whereas it's correct interpretation is of highness and establishment without asking how or making similitude.

    The definition of Apparent (Ad-Dhahir)

- The term "Apparent" (Ad-Dhahir) carries a linguist connotation of clarity and visibility. Technically, it dentoes what it most likely in meaning, although other interpretation are possible.
  - For instance, consider the Prophet's (ﷺ) statement: "Make ablution after (eating) camel meat." Here, the apparent meaning of ablution refers to the prescribed ritual ablution , not merely washing oneself.
  - What we exclude from "most likely in meaning" is anything categorised as al-Mujmal because it doesn't independently conveys a specific meaning.
    - Additionally, we exclude from "most likely in meaning" the interpreted, as it would suggest a less accurate view without an external factor.
      - Lastly, what we exclude from "although other interpretations are possible" is the clear text, which conveys only one definitive meaning.

**** Examples
- The indication of a *command* (الأمر) for *obligation*, while it can also
  possibly indicate *recommendation*.
- The indication of a *prohibition* (النهي) for *prohibition* (taḥrīm), while
  it can also possibly indicate *dislike* (karāhah).

Examples from the sayings of the Prophet ﷺ:
- “Pray as you have seen me pray.”  
  (Agreed upon)
  - commanded, but connect with other meanings
    - it possible to have other meaning here
      - one stick out
        - this mean adh dhair text
          - it may suggest recommedn and permissible, even when it comes as a command
- “Do not sell what you do not have.”  
  (Narrated by Aḥmad and the authors of the Sunan)
  - don't sell has 3 possible meaning
    - if you prohibit the default is prohib unless you have something else 
- when you have a general term, its is understood as the general term, but there may be many different forms of that general term which may not be apprent.
  - the scholars say it is wajib to act on the apprent meaning unless you have a valid reason to not to.
    - e.g what we learned from before in terms of the signs and idication

Acting upon the Apparent (text)

- Acting upon the apparent text is obligatory unless there is evidence that deviates from its apparent meaning.

       - In Al-Mā’idah: 3, “blood” is mentioned in a general form.
       - In Al-An‘ām: 145, the “blood” is specified as *flowing blood*.
    - A general word could, in principle, include animals of the land, sky, and sea.
      - Other clear texts show that sea creatures (fish) are permissible, so the general wording cannot be understood to include them.
        - The same applies to locusts, which are explicitly exempted in other texts.
          - Therefore, scholars reduce the scope of the general term so that it excludes fish and locusts, keeping the prohibition only for the remaining animals.

3. The word being interpreted must be able to *bear* the intended meaning,
   even if it is a less likely possibility.
   - other words, the Arabic language itself must recognise this as a valid possible meaning of the word.
     - If the language does not allow this meaning, then the interpretation is invalid, even if someone claims it fits.
     - Example:Allah says: “Ḥurrimat ʿalaykum al-maytatu…” – “Forbidden to you is al-maytah (dead meat)…”
       - Some might falsely claim that al-maytah here means “dead human beings,” and then argue that this allows eating humans.
         - But in Arabic usage (and in the shar‘ī usage of the fuqahā’), al-maytah refers to the carcass of an animal that died without proper slaughter – not human flesh.
           - Since the word does not bear the meaning of “humans” in this context, such an interpretation is invalid and counted as false ta’wīl (تأويل فاسد).

Abrogations,
- linguistically,
  - entail removal or copying.
- Technically,
  - it refers to the removal of a legal ruling or its wording, replaced by another evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah.
    - By "remove a ruling", we mean changing from obligation to permissibility or vice versa.

However, this does not encompass situations like non-implementation due to condition or preventive factors.
- For instance, the obligation of Zakah may be lifted due to not meeting the set limit, or the obligation of prayer during menstruation;
  - these instance are not termed as abrogations.

Regarding "or its wording", it refers to the legal proof within the text because abrogation can involve
- either the ruling without the wording or vice versa, or both.
  -  Not included in this definition are evidence from consensus and analogy, as they cannot abrogate.

Indeed, abrogation is intellectually acceptable and legal reality in Shariah.
- Intellectually, it aligns with the understanding that Allah possesses absolute power and authority, being the ultimate owner and legislator.
  - Thus, He may enact laws as He sees fit, guided by His wisdom and mercy for His servants.
    - It's reasonable to acknowledge that the possessor orders his possession as He deems appropriate.

- His wisdom and mercy necessitate legislation that serves the best interests of His creation in both worldly life and the hereafter, recognising that circumstances and benefits vary over time and places.

Therefore, ruling that is beneficial at one time or state may differ in its applicability or benefit at another time.
- Allah, being All-knowing and All-Wise, decree what is most beneficial for His servant based on His perfect knowledge and wisdom.

As for its occurrence in the Shariah then the evidence are many, from them:
1. The saying of the Most High:
   "We do not abrogate the verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it" 2:106
2. The saying of the Most High:
   "Now, Allah has lightened [the hardship] for you" 8:66
   "So now, have relations with them" 2: 187
   This text was revealed to change the previous ruling.
3. The saying for the Prophet (ﷺ)
   "I used to forbid you from visiting graves so visit them (from now on)"
   This text abrogated the prohibition of visiting the graves.
** What prevents abrogation taking place
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a23da66c-6026-4bb4-a55e-cbe5c9911c34
:END:
Abrogation is prevented from the taking place in the following:
1. News: Abrogation is prevented from occurring in matters of news because it deals specifically with rulings.
   - In cases where a ruling is conveyed in the form of news, abrogation can still apply.
     - An example is found in the Quran, where Allah initially state:
       - "if there are among you twenty [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred" 8:65
       - This statement conveys a ruling in the form of news. However, in the very next verse, Allah abrogates this ruling with:
       - "Now, Allah has lightened [the hardship] for you, and he knows that among you is weakness. So if there are from you one hundred who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred" 8:66
       - Here, the initial ruling is replace by a new one, demonstrating the occurrence of abrogation even in matters initially presented as news.

2. Indeed, rulings that are universally beneficial, applicable in every time and place,
   - such as the principle of Tawhid, the fundamental tenets of faith, and moral virtues like honesty, chastity, generosity, and courage, cannot be subject to abrogations.
     - Similarly, prohibitions against universally recognised evils such as Shrik and Kufr, as well as immoral behaviour like lying, immorality, greed and cowardice, remains constant across all ages and regions.
       - These laws are established for the welfare of humanity and to prevent harm and corruption.
         - Therefor, they are immutable and not subjected to abrogation.

** Conditions of Abrogation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       dd7eb74b-4d6e-49e2-8860-03ed3de9beff
:END:

The conditions for abrogation that are required for what can be abrogated include:

1. Incompatibility of Evidence:
   - Abrogation requires two piece of evidence that cannot be reconciled or combined, as their simultaneous application would render abrogation unnecessary. If compatibility exists, abrogation does not apply.
     
   - And an example of knowledge reaching us by way of information from a companion is the statement of A'ishah, who reported that it had been revealed in the Holy Qur'an that then clear breast feeding make the marriage unlawful, the it was abrogated (and substituted) by five breast feedings.
     
2. Chronological Sequence:
   - it is essential to establish that the abrogating text was revealed later than the abrogated one. This knowledge can be obtained from explicit texts, reports from companions, or historical context. For instance, the Prophet's statement about the prohibition of temporary marriage indicates a later revelation, he said, "I authorised you to enjoy women (through temporary marriage), indeed Allah has now forbidden it until the Day of Resurrections."
   
   - And an example of knowledge garnered through history occurs in the saying of the Most High : Now Allah has lightened the burden from you. The word 'now' indicates that this ruling is the latter (of whatever preceded it of the same issue). Similarly, if it were stated that the Prophet (ﷺ) gave a ruling for something before the migration, and then gave another ruling after that which opposed the first then the second one would be counted as the abrogating one.


3. Validation of the abrogating text.
   - The majority has stipulated that the abrogating text be stronger than what is abrogating or at least similar, there the mutawatir (the narrations that has multiple narrators) would not be abrogated by narrations that are ahad (narrations that have a single narrator at each level of the chain), even if it is established (as correct narration),
     - what is most correct is that it not be stipulated whether or not the abrogating text be stronger or similar, reason being the purpose of the abrogation is the ruling, and so it should require it to be mutawatir for it to take place.

** Categories of Abrogation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e3fdc13b-6039-42f0-84fd-598ffc7c262f
:END:
Abrogation is divided into three segments with regards to the abrogated text:

1. When the ruling has been abrogated and the wording has remained, this is frequent in the Qur'an.
   - An example of which are the two verse of patience:
     - "if there are among you twenty who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred" 8:65
       
   - Its ruling abrogated by the saying of the Most High:
     - "New, Allah has lightened the hardship for you, and he knows that among you is weakness. So if there are from you one hundred who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are among you a thousand, they will overcome two thousand by the permission of Allah. And Allah is with the steadfast." 8:66

   - And the wisdom of abrogating the ruling and not the verse is to allow the reward of reciting it to remain, and a reminder to the Muslims of the wisdom behind the abrogation.

2. When the wording has been abrogated but the ruling remains,
   - such as the verse of stoning.
     - Indeed it has been established in Bukhari and Muslim from the narration of ibn Abass and Umar bin Al Khattab said:
       - "The verse of stoning was amongst the other verse that Allah revealed in the Qur'an so we read it and understood it properly and the Prophet (ﷺ) stoned and we stoned after him, but I fear after a the passing of time people will come to say:"
         
         - "By Allah we do not find the verse of atoning in the Book of Allah! So they will become misguided by leaving an obligation that Allah has revealed, even though stoning is in the Book of Allah, a right upon those that commit fornication/ adultery from the chaste men and women, and if the evidence is established, the women is pregnant or if there is an acknowledgement".

       - The wisdom of abrogating the wording but not the ruling is to text the Ummah to see if they will act upon something that is not in the Qur'an and fulfilling their belief in what Allah has revealed the exact opposite of the state of the Jews that tried to hide the verse of stoning in the Torah.

3. What has been abrogated both in wording and ruling:
   -  such as the abrogation of the ten breast feedings as in the previous narration of A'ishah

** The Abrogating Text
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4ec88b96-937a-4312-adca-5e64fce5c982
:END:
Abrogation is divided into four categories with regards to the abrogating text

Abrogation of the:
1. Qur'an by Qur'an
   - like the verse of patience (mentions above)
2. Qur'an by the Sunnah
   - I have not found a proper example for this.
3. Sunnah by Qur'an:
   - an example of which is the abrogation of facing the Sacred House in Jerusalem which was established by the sunnah, to facing the ka'bah which was in turn established by the saying of the Most High:
     - "So turn your face toward al-masjid al-haram. And wherever you believers are, turn your face toward it in prayer"
4. Sunnah by Sunnah,
   - and example of which is the saying of the Prophet:
     - "I had forbidden you from the drinking (and preparation of) Nabidh in the vessels made out of leather, but (now) you may drink in all vessel, butt do not  drink intoxicants"
** The Wisdom of Abrogation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a8b7f352-abc9-4f6c-b609-a7304a6cb059
:END:
There are many wisdom for Abrogation; from them:
1. Taking into account the interest of people by legislating what is best for them in their religious and worldly affairs
2. Gradually developing the legislation until it reaches perfection
3. Testing the mukllafeen, their readiness to accept the transition from one rule to another and being content with it
4. Testing the mukallafin to see if they give thanks for when the abrogation make things lighter for them, to see if they are patient when the abrogating text is harder for them.
* Al-Akhbar
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6f074b07-242a-4cd9-9a80-de2f080f37d1
:END:

The Definition Al-Akhbar
- linguistically
  - means news.
- But what is intended here is:
  - that which is attributed to the Prophet (ﷺ) speech, actions, tacit approval or description.

we've previously mentioned about the fulling of the Prophet (ﷺ) speech.

Types of Actions of the Prophet (ﷺ)
The actions of the Prophet Muhammed (ﷺ) can be classified into different categories
1. Natural Disposition.
   - These are actions that are apart of his innate human nature, such as eating, drinking and sleeping. While they do not inherently constitute rulings, they may be commanded or prohibited based on specific reason or sought-after descriptions, like eating with the right hand.
   
2. Habitual Actions.
   - These are actions performed by the Prophet based on his personal habits, such as his choice of clothing. While the actions themselves may be permissible, they may be recommended or discouraged for other based on additional factors.
   
3. Exclusive Actions.
   - These are actions performed uniquely by the Prophet that are specific to him alone, such as continuous fasting for days without interruption or marrying women without a guardian. Exclusivity is not assumed for other individual unless there is evidence to support it, as the norm is to follow the Prophet's example.

4. Worship Actions.
   - These are actions performed by the Prophet in worship to Allah, which were obligatory for him until he received divine  orders to proclaim their obligation. Afterwards, they come recommended for him and the community based on the most correct opinion, that is because of the fact that if he did something, it indicate that it has basis in the Shariah, so the norm is that there is no punishment for leaving the actions, as it is legislated without any punishment for leaving it, and this is the reality of mandub (recommended)

     An example of that is the narration of A'isha when she was asked what the Prophet began with when he entered his house? she said "With the siwak", there is nothing in the siwak whilst entering the house except an action, so it is mandub

     Another example is the Prophet wiping his beard by passing his finger through from behind his beard to the front in a combing motion during wudo. This action is not considered a part of washing the face; and it is only an action so it reaches the level of mandub

5. Clarifying Ambiguities:
   - The Prophet's actions often served to elucidate ambiguous text from the Quran and Sunnah, initially obligatory for him until clarification was received, these actions helped clarify the rulings for both him and his followers. If the clarified ruling is obligatory, the action becomes obligatory; if recommended, it becomes recommended for both the Prophet and his follower.

An example of an obligation is the obligatory action of the prayer that the Prophet (ﷺ) did, thereby removing the ambiguity of the saying of the Most High:
 - "And establish the prayer" 2:43
   - And example of mandub:
     - His praying of two units behind the station of Ibrahim after completing the tawaf enacting the saying of the Most High:
       - "And take the station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer" 2:125
         - By going toward the station of Ibrahim, while reading the verse, and offering two rak'ahs as a Sunnah
         - The approval of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) serves as evidence of the permissibility of a particular action or statement in the manner it was approved by him. This applies whether it pertain to speech or action.
           - For instance, his approval of a statement is exemplified by an incident where the questioned a slaved girl about the whereabout of Allah, and upon her repsonce that he "above the sky" he approved of her answer.
           - Similarly, his approval of certain actions is demonstrated in various instance. For example, when the Prophet (ﷺ) learned that a companion regularly recited Surah al-Iklas in every rak'ah of his prayer out of love for its description of Allah's mercy, the Prophet (ﷺ) praised him and conveyed Allah's love for him.
           - Another illustration is his approval of Abyssinians playing in the mosque to draw them closer to Islam.
 Action that occurred during his lifetime but of which he was not aware cannot be directly attributed to him. However, they serve as evidence of Allah's approval, as highlighted by the practice of 'Azl (coitus interruptus) during the revelation of the Qur'an.
  - The companions cited this as evidence of it permissibility reason that if it were prohibited, the Qur'an would have explicitly addressed it.
    - The fact that reprehensible actions attempted to be concealed by hypocrites were exposed and condemned by Allah further underscore that his silence on certain matter signifies their permissibility.
      - This indicate that actions or statement approved by Allah, even if not explicitly addressed in revelation, are deemed permissible.

** The categories of news in light of who they are attributed to
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5d3263c0-2d68-4316-b5c7-52232f8ce500
:END:

News is divided into three categories with regards to who they are attributed to: Marfu', Mawquf and Maqtu'.

1. Marfu': What is attributed to the prophet (ﷺ) in actual terms or through a judgement (he passed) .
   
   As for marfu in actual terms, it is the words of the Prophet (ﷺ), his actions and tacit approvals.
   
   And marfu' through judgement is what is attributed to his Sunnah, or his reign or the like and whatever shows that he had no direct contact with, such as the saying of a companion: We have been commanded or forbidden etc, as in the words of ibn Abbas "The people were commanded to make the last they do before leaving Makkah: tawaf of the Ka'bah, except for menstruating women" And the words of Umm Atiyah: we were forbidden to follow the funerals procession..
   
2. Mawquf: What is attributed to a companion but not proven to be from the Prophet himself, then the most correct opinion is this can be used as an evidence except in the case where it contradicts a text (Qur'an and Sunnah) in which case we go by the text, or that it contradicts the statement of another companion, then the most correct opinion is taken of the two. A companion is whoever met the Prophet, believed in him and died upon that.

3. Maqtu': What is attributed to a Tabi'i and anyone after him.
   The Tabi'is is whoever met a companion as a believer and died upon that.

** Categories of news with regards ot its chians (of narrations)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       010a1de9-0749-4d7d-add5-21a568ffc8d6
:END:

News can be divided into Mutawatir and Ahad with regards to it chains of narrations:

1. Mutawatir: definition: News narrated by many people, making it virtually impossible for them to have conspired to lie.
   
   Example: The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) statement: "Whoever deliberately lie about me, let him take his place in the Fire".
   
2. Ahad: definition: news with a lesser number of narrators compared to Mutawatir.
   Further divided into:
   a. Sahih (Authentic): Narrated by an upright individual with precise recollection, featuring a connected chain of narration without anomalies or hidden defect.
   b. Hasan (Good): Narrated by a generally pious individual with reasonable precision and a connected chain of narration, free of anomalies or hidden defect. It may be elevated to Sahih status if supported by numerous chains of narrations, knows a "Sahih due to others".
   c. Da'if (Weak): narrations that do not meet the conditions of Sahih or Hasan. However, if supported by multiple chians of narration, it may be elevated to Hasan status know as "Hasan due to others".

Status as Evidence
- All categories except Da'if are considered evidences.
- Da'if narrations are not considered evidence, but may be mentioned as supporting evidence for establishing matters sourced form authentic means.

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       996c9e60-e1cc-4535-8575-4628de5ee16f
:END:
Tahammul
Definition: Taking the narration from other.
Example: When a student listens to their teacher's narration.

Ada'
Definition: Propagating the narration to others.
Example: When a student narrates what they've learned from their teacher to another person

Formats of Ada'
1. Hadathani (He narrated to me): Used when the narrator's sheikh read the narration to them
2. Akhbaran (He informed me): Used when the narrator's sheikh either reads the narration to them or the narrator reads to their sheikh
3. Akbarani Ijazah or Ajaza I (He informed me with permission): Used when the narrator received permission (Ijazah) form their sheikh to narrate, even if they didn't read the narration.
4. Anana (From): used when the narrator narrates using the word "An" (from). The chain is considered connected unless the narrator is known for "Tadlis" (concealment), in which case it is not considered connected unless explicitly stated by the narrator.
   
Additional Notes
There are many types of hadith narrating in the field of Hadith science, but the above example cover the essential modes of narrating.
** Consensus (Al-Ijama')
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       56486d53-3c26-4e73-a045-9702e8ca804b
:END:
Definition:
Linguistically: Determination and agreement.
Technical: Agreement between the "Mujtahidin" ( Scholars capable of independent reasoning) of this ummah after the Prophet (ﷺ) on an Islamic ruling.

Exclusion:
Disagreement: Even disagreement form one scholar nullifies consensus.
Mujtahidin: Excludes common pepole and blind followers.
This Ummah: Exclude consensus of other nations.
After the Prophet: Excludes agreement during the Prophet's time, as evidence is derived from his Sunnah.
Islamic Rulings: Excludes agreement on intellectual or habitual matters.

Proofs Of Evidence:
1. Quranic Verse 2:143: "And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people"
2. Quranic Verse 4:59: "And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger"
3. Hadith: "My ummah will not unite upon misguidance"
4. So we say: The Consensus of the ummah on something is either true, and can be false. If it is true then it is an evidence, and if it is false, then how can this ummah, that is the most honourable of nation to Allah since the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) until the coming of the last hour, unite upon something false that Allah is not please with? This is from the greatest impossibilities.

** Types of Consensus
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       abe27d11-808b-4754-983e-0a2dbe0e7417
:END:
Consensus can be categorised into type types: Qati and Dhanni

1. Qati (Definitive):
   It is known to have occurred in the Ummah without any doubt.
   Example include consensus on the necessity of the five daily prayer and the prohibition of adultery.
   Denying this type of consensus is tantamount ot disbelief, as it is unquestionably considered evidence.
2. Dhanni' (Presumptive):
   This type requires thorough reseach to ascertain.
   Scholars differ on its actual possibility of being proven.
   The most correct view, according to Sheikh al-Islam ibn Taymiyah, as mentioned in Al-Aqwwdah Al-Qastiyah, is that consensus is what was enjoined by the salaf (early generation of Muslim), as after them, difference emerged and the ummah spread.

Conclusion:
It's inconceivable for the ummah to unite against clear, authentic, and un-abrogated evidence. Therefore, if a consensus appears to contradict such evidence, further examination is necessary. There may be issues with the authenticity, clarity, abrogation, or underlying disagreement not readily apparent.
         
** Conditions for Consensus
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9c95ee1b-1a97-4a61-95ec-ebd4c864e358
:END:
The conditions for consensus are as follows:
1. Authenticity of the Route: Consensus must be proven via an authentic route, either well-known among scholars or conveyed from trustworthy source who are well-read.
2. Absence of Firmly-based Disagreement: Consensus cannot be preceded by a firmly-based disagreement. If there was such a disagreement, consensus cannot be claimed, as statements are not nullified simply because their proponents have passed away.

So, consensus cannot remove former dispute, rather it deters disputes from taking place at all, and this is the most correct opinion due to the strength of its objections; it has also been said: that is not stipulated, so it is correct that people in the second era gathered upon one of the statements of the previous generations then they would be an evidence for those that come after them.

According to the majority opinion, it is not necessary for the era of those achieving consensus to end for subsequent consensus to be valid. Once agreement is reach, it hold irrespective of the passing of the era. Those who agreed cannot later object, as consensus is considered established from the moment of agreement.

When Mujtahideen make statements or perform actions that become well-known among scholars of Ijithad, and they do not object despite having the ability to do so, it is considered consensus by some. Others argue it may be evidence but not consensus. Still, another view suggests it is neither evidence nor consensus. The closest to the truth is deemed to be when those with the ability to object pass away without doing so, indicating implicit agreement thought silence.

* Analogy (Al-Qiyas)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       47565ee6-391e-4a93-829b-d01701a7c2da
:END:
Definition: linguistically, "qiyas" means appreciation and equality. Technically, it means drawing a similarity between a subsidiary issue and a core issue in a ruling that pertains to a common element between them.

- Subsidiary Issues (Al-Far'): The subject to which the analogy is applied.
- Core issues (Al-'Asl): The subject from which the analogy is drawn.
- Ruling (Al-Hukm): Refers to what the evidence necessitates in terms of obligation, prohibition, correctness, or incorrectness.
- Common Elements: Refers to the meaning with which the reason for the ruling of the primary issue is made.

  There four pillars constitutes analogy, which is a legal source of evidence used to establish legal ruling.

  What demonstrates that it's to be considered as a legal source of evidence is the Qur'an and Sunnah and the saying of the Companions.

  Evidence from the Quran: 
  1. The saying of the Most High:
     "It is Allah who has sent down the Book in truth adn also the balance" 42:17

     The Qur'an metions "the balance, which is used to weigh up  affairs and make analogies between them.

  2. The saying of the Most High:
    "As we began the first creation, we will repeat it" 21:104
    "And it is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and we drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrections" 35:9
   
    Allah's likening of the returning of creation to its beginning and the revival of the dead to the revival of the earth demonstrates analogy.
    
 Evidence from the Sannah
 1. The saying of the Prophet (ﷺ) to the women who asked him about making up the fast to her mother after she had died: "What do you think if your mother was in debt and you settled it for her would that then not be lifted form her? she said: Yes So he said Then fast for your mother".

    The Prophet's response to a woman about fasting for her deceased mother, likening it to settling her debts.

2. A man came to the Prophet and said, "O Messenger of Allah! A black child has been born to me" The Prophet asked him, "Have you got camels" The man said "Yes" The Prophet asked him "What colour are they?" The man replied "Red" The prophet said "is there a grey one among them?" The man replied "Yes". The Prophet said "Where did it come from" He said "Maybe it is hereditary". The Prophet said, "May be your new born has this colour because of hereditary"
   
   The Prophet (ﷺ) response to a man about the colour of his newborn child, drawing an analogy to genetics.

Statements of the Scholars:
Umar bin Al Khattab letter to Abu Musa al Ash-ari emphasices the use of analogy in understanding matter not explicitly addressed in the Quran and Sunnah.

He said "As for understanding properly what comes to you, from these issues that are not in the Quran nor in the Sunnah, the make analogy of the affairs that are with you and know the examples, then rely on what you hold to be most beloved to Allah, and the most resembling of the truth".

Ibn al-Qayim said: "This magnificent letter has been received by the scholars with acceptance".

Al-Muzani has mentioned that the scholars from the era of the Companions to his day agreed that what resembles the truth is the truth and likewise what resembles falsehood is falsehood, and so they used the standards of analogy in fiqh for all the rulings.

(Analogy is considered a valid legal source because it involved considering similarities between different situations to derive rulings)

** Conditions of Analogy
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9adb04ae-adaf-46e9-a240-84ab59a7b49e
:END:
These conditions ensure the validity and correctness of analogy

1. Non-contradiction
   Analogy should not conflict with stronger evidence such as text, consensus, or the statement of the Companions; so we say: The statement of the Comanions are evidence, and Analogy that is in conflict with what has been mentioned is regarded as a corrupt analogy
   
   For instace, if someone argues that a women can marry without a guardian based on an analogy with her ability to sell property independently, it contradicts the clear statement of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), "There is no marriage without a wali (guardian)" This analogy is flawed because it goes against explicit textual evidence.
   
2. Based on Established Primary Issues
   Analogy should stem from primary issues established by text or consensus. analogising a secondary issue as a primary one or building analogies upon other analogies without reference to established primary issues is incorrect.

   For instance, if someone claims that usury occurs in corn based on an analogy with rice, and then extends this analogy to claim that usury also occurs in rice based on analogy with corn, it is flawed. Instead, the analogy should be rooted in an established primary issue, such as usury in rice being analogised with ususry in corn. (This approach ensures a more sound and valid analogical reasoning).

 3. Understating the Cause.
    Analogy requires an understanding of the cause behind the ruling of a primary issue, enabling comparison with subsidiary issue. If the primary issue's rationale is solely an act of worship to Allah, analogising it is inappropriate.

    For instance, claiming that ostrich meant breaks wudu based on an analogy with camel meat due to the similarity is flawed. This analogy fails because the primary ruling's reason, wudu nullification, is not based on a common factor but rather an act of worship. Therefore, analogising such issues based on worship realted ruling is not valid.

 4. Suitable Mutual Reason
    Analogies must rely on a mutual reason that aligns with the principles of legislation, such as the intoxicating effect of alcohol. If the comparison involves a direct description lacking suitability, it it's invalid.

    For example, in the hadith of Ibn Abbas mentioning Barirah's husband as a black slave, his race has no relevance to the ruling. Therefore, analogising based on irrelevant descriptions, like colour, is incorrect, therefore a women once freed is give the choice if her husband remains a slave to stay with him or not, even if he is white, but she is not given the choice if her husband is free even if he is black. (Analogies should focus on meaningful similarities related to the legislative principle to ensure their validity)

  5. Presence of common Cause
     Analogies require the presence of a common cause in both the primary and secondary matter

     For instance, analogising the harm in striking parents with the use of the word "Uff" relies on a shared cause. If the cause is absent in the secondary matter, the analogy is invalid. For example, suggesting that the prohibition of usury, based on its measurability, applies to apples as it does to wheat is flawed. Since apples aren't weight like wheat, the common cause essential for analogy is lacking, rendering the comparison incorrect. (analogies must ensure the presence of shared cause to maintain their validity)
     
** Categories of Analogy
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6868dad8-0874-4fae-a918-f76a0c3d09a6
:END:
Analogy is divided into clear and hidden:
1. Clear Analogy
   - clear analogy is characterised by having its cause established through a text, consensus, or a maqtu'(a statement that stops at a companion), where the difference between the primary and secondary source is negated.
   - an example of clear analogy based on a text is the prohibition of using dry unclean blood for purification after relieving oneself with the prohibition of using dry dung. This analogy is supported by a text where Ibn Mas'ood brought two stones and dry dung to the Prophet (ﷺ), who discarded the dung, declaring it impure.
   - Another example based on consensus in the Prophet (ﷺ) forbidding an angry judge from passing judgement. Analogy with someone suffering from constipation, due to both being preoccupied and having confused thoughts, is a clear analogy supported by concensus.
   - Maqtu' analogies, such as the prohibition of squandering the wealth of orphans on unnecessary clothing, analogised with squandering it on food, also fall under clear analogies due to the negation of any difference between the primary and secondary rulings.
2. The Hidden Analogy
   - Hidden analogy involves deducing its cause through careful analysis, but without clearly negating the difference between the primary and secondary issues.
   - An example is the analogy between Ashnan(a type of plant) and wheat is the prohibition of usury in all measurements. While the cause is measuring hasn't been established by text or consensus, and the difference between wheat and Ashnan hasn't been clearly negated, it's permissible to distinguish between them by highlighting that wheat is consumed while Ashnan is not.
** Analogy of Similarities
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0d4e4e84-5cfb-438a-91d7-5f111d2ddca9
:END:
'Qiyas ash-Shibh' (the analogy of likeness) involves a secondary matter positioned between two different primary matters due to its similarities with both. The secondary matter is aligned with the primary matter it shares the most commonalities with. For example, consider the analogy of a slave: is he owned like property, akin to a free person, or is he not owned resembling an animal?

Upon examining these two primary issues, one involving a free person and the other an animal, we find that the status of a slave oscillates between the two. In terms of intellectual capcity, accountability, marital freedom, and other aspect related to personhood, the slave resembles a free person. However, regarding aspects such as being bought and sold, use as collateral, disposed of, etc, the slave resembles an animal in financial dealings.

This type of analogy is considered weak because there isn't suitable common cause between them other than the slave resembling an animal in most financial dealings, despite the dispute presented by another primary ruling.

** Analogy of Opposite
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       235b2c81-3ccf-4770-9a2f-11e51590e34d
:END:
"Qiyas Al-Aks" ( analogy of opposites) involves affirming the opposite of a ruling of a primary issue to for the secondary issue, due to the presence of the oppsing cause in the primary ruling.

An example of this type of analogy is found in the saying of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) "... and is using your private part (lawfully) is a type of charity" Upon hearing this, come companions were puzzled and asked: "O Messenger of Allah! Does one of us fulfil his desire and then gets rewarded for it?" In response, the Prophet clarified: "do you not see that if he were to do it in a forbidden way, he would be punished for it?" So if he does it in the right way, he is rewarded.

In this example, the Prophet affirmed the opposite rulings for the secondary issue, which is engaging in lawful intercourse, compared the primary ruling, which pertains to engaging in intercourse in a forbidden manner. This affirmation is based on the presence of the opposing cause; engaging in the act lawfully leads to rewards, whereas engaging in it unlawfully results in punishment.

* Contradiction (at-ta'arud)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d7374500-3e8e-4308-ad97-e47a61ad44a4
:END:
The definition: At-ta'arud linguistically refers to the opposition or preventions of one thing by another. Technically, it denotes a situation in Islamic jurisprudence where two piece of evidence conflict or oppose each other.

And the contradiction has four parts.

Part A) Contradiction between two general evidence can result in four cases:
1. Combination:
    if the two conflicting evidence can be reconciled in a way that they don't contradict each other, then they should be combined. An example of this is reconciling the verse where Allah says to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) "And indeed [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path" 42:52 with "You [O Muhammad] do not guide whom you love" 28:56. Here, the first verse refers to guidance as directing to the right path, which the Prophet doe, while the second verse refers to the ability to act upon guidance, which is in Allah's hand alone.
2. Abrogation:
    If reconciliations is not possible, the later evidence may abrogate the earlier one if the historical context is known. For instance the verse allowing the option between fasting and feeding the needy, "And whoever volunteers excess - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew" 2:184 was abrogated by the verse specifying the obligation to fast during Ramadan, "So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days" 2:185 
3. Preferable Opinion:
    if the historical context is unknown, the most probable opinion should be followed if one exists. For example, the Prophet's statement that one who touches their private part should perform ablution contradicts his statement that it is part of oneself. The former opinion is preferred due to it cautiousness, freqency in narrations, authenticity, and direct attribution to the prophet (ﷺ).
4. No Preferred Opinion:
    If there is no preferable opinion, neither should be acted upon, though no sound example can be found for this scenario.

Part B) Contradiction between two specific text also presents four scenarios
1. Reconciliation
    If both text can be harmonised without conflict, then reconciliation is necessary. For instance, the narration of Jabir stating that the Prophet (ﷺ)  prayer Zuhr on the Day of Sacrifice in Makkah, and the narrations of Ibn Umar indicating that the Prophet (ﷺ)  prayer Zuhr in Mina, are reconciled by considering that the prophet prayer in both locations with his companions.
2. Abrogation
   If reconciliation is not possible, and the history of text is known, the second text abrogate the first.
   An example is the Quranic verse regarding the Prophet's wives, where the second verse abrogates the permissibility of additional marriage mentioned in the first verse.
   An example for that is the saying of the Most High:
   "O Prophet, indeed we have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what Allah has returned to you [of captives] and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of you paternal aunt" 33:50
   And His saying:
   "Not lawful to you [O Muhammad], are [any additional] women after [this] nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you" 33:52
3. Preference
   If no abrogation is found, then the more preferred test should be followed if one is identifiable.
   Example: The narration of Maymunah, that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her while he was not in the state of ihram, and the narrations of Ibn Abbas, that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her while being in the state of ihram.
   The most correct opinion is the first because Maymunah is the person telling the story so she is more aware of what happened. Her narration is supported by the other narration of Abu Rafi that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her while he was not in the state of ihram and he said I was the messenger between them.  
4. Stalemate
   If neither text can be preferred over the other, then both should be disregarded. However such scenario doesn't exist.

Part C) When a contradiction arises between a specific text and a general text, the specific text restricts the general text. For example, the Prophet (ﷺ) statement regarding Zakat being a tenth of what the sky water is made specific by his statement that anything less than five aswaq is not zakat, thus, zakat is only obligatory for produce reaching or exceeding five aqsaq. 

Part D) When one text is more genreal in one aspect and mor specific in another aspect compare to another text, there are three cases

1. Specification of Generality
   If one text makes specific the general of the other, the more specific text is followed. For instance, the quranic verse specifying the waiting period for widows is made specific by the verse specifying the waiting period for pregnant women.
   
   Example: The saying of the Most High:
   "And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind-they [the wives,shall] wait four months and ten [days]"

   and the saying:
   "and for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth" 65:4
   The first verse is specific about its mention of widows but general when it comes to pregnant women. The second verse is specific about pregnant women but general about widows so the proof shows that the generality of the first one is made specific by the second one. Subiya Al-Aslamiah gave birth after her husband died by a few nights, and the Prophet (ﷺ)  allowed her to get married, based on this the iddah for the pregnant women is when she gives birth whether she is a widow or otherwise 
   
2. Preference
   If neither text specifies the generality of the other, the more preferred view is followed. For example, the saying of the Propeht (ﷺ)  "If one of you enter the mosque let him not sit down until he prayer two rak'ah" and his saying "There is no prayer after Fajr until the sun rises and no prayer after Asr until the sun goes down."
   The first is specific regarding the two rak'ah that are prayed before siting down in the masjid, but general about time. The second is specific about the time but genreal about the type of prayer, which includes the tahiyahtul masjid and other than that, but the most preferred opinion is  to make specific the generality of thee second with the firs , so it is permissible to pray tahiyahtul Masjid during the times that are prohibited for general prayers to be prayed therein.
   We prefer this opinion because making specific the generality of the second has been confirmed for other prayer beside the tahiyahtul masjid such as making up the missed obligatory prayers, or praying again in congregation, so the generality has a weak position.
   
3. Silent Adherence
   If there is no evidence or method to specify the genereal meaning of conflicting text, both text are followed in the aspect where they do not conflict, while remaining silent on the conflict aspect.

However, it is not possible for there to be a contradiction between text of the same issue in a way that they cannot be reconciled, or that one of them is abrogating the other, or that one cannot be given preference over the other because the text do not contradict each other. The messenger (ﷺ) has made things perfectly clear and propagated (the message) so, it may be that the Mujtahid fell short in his understanding of the text, and Allah knows best.
   
(It's important to note that contradictions betwen text on the same issues are not inherent, and they can often be reconciled, abrogated, or one can be given preference over the other. If contradictions seem irreconcilable, it indicates a limitation in the understanding of the texts rather than an actual contradiction.)      

** The order between the Evidence
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       efffbbf3-bb0b-4043-a65e-eb1e9fb60afe
:END:
When the evidence mentioned previously (The Quran, Sunnah, consensus and analogy) agree on a ruling, or one of them does without contradicting the other source of evidence, then affirming it is compulsory. If there is a contradiction and it is possible to reconcile them then that is what must be done. If that is not the case then the abrogating text should be acted upon if the conditions are met. If all of that is not possible then one text must be given preference.

Here's a summary of the order between the evidence:

From the Qur'an and Sunnah
1. The Apparent Text: The clear straightforward meaning of a text is given precedence over interpretation or ambiguous meaning.
2. The Apparent Text over the Interpreted Text: If there is a conflict between a clear text and an interpreted one, the clear text is followed.
3. The explicitly stated over the Understood: Direct statement take precedence over inferred meaning.
4. Affirming Text over Negating Text: A text that affirms something is prioritised over one that denies it.
5. Narrator of the Primary Source: The one narrating the original source of the information is given preference, as they likely have more knowledge.
6. Preserved General Text over Non-preserved General Text: a general text that has been preserved in its original form is prioritised over a general text that has not been preserved.
7. Text with More Affirmation: A text that is affirmed by more sources or has stronger evidence is given precedence 
8. Person of the Story: The testimony of the person involved in the story or event is prioritised over other.
   
From consensus:
9. Qati' (Clear Cut) consensus over Dhanni (uncertain) Consensus: Consensus that is indisputable and clearly established is a given precedence over uncertain consensus.

From Analogy:
10. Clear Text over Hidden Text: When applying analogy, a clear text is prioritised over a hidden or ambiguous text. 

By adhering to this order, scholars ensure a systematic approach to deriving rulings from Islamic source, maintaining coherence and consistency in jurisprudence. 

* The Mufti and The Mustafti
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5fe1016c-4678-437b-bd45-0aed866877f2
:END:
The Mufti is the one who has knowledge of the legal rulings.
The Mustafti is a questioner that ask for a legal ruling

** The Conditions of Fatwa
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       67eb7258-3b37-4114-9720-18fe764731bc
:END:
The requirements for the permissibility of a fatwa, which, if they are not met then the correct fatwa will not be obtained:

1. Certainty of Knowledge: The Mufti must have certain or a strong conviction of the legal ruling regarding the matter at hand. If there is doubt or uncertainty, the Mufti should refrain from issuing a fatwa.
2. Understanding the Question Fully: The Mufti must fully comprehend the question asked by the Mustafti in order to provide an accurate judgement. If the question is unclear or ambiguous, the Mufti should seek clarification or provide futher details in the answer
   
   So if someone dies and leaves behind a daughter, a brother and an uncle. Ask about the brothe was he from the mother or not? Or make the distinction in the answer. So if he was form the mother then there is nothing for him in inheritance and the remainder after what belongs to the daughter is for the uncle, and if he is from another mother, then the whats left after the daughter takes whats hers, is for him.
3. Calm State of Mind:  The mufti should be in a calm and compose state of mind when issuing a fatwa. Fatwas should not be given impulsively or in a state of anger, preoccupation, or boredom. Instead, the Mufti should take the time to carefully consider the issue and apply legal evidence appropriately.
** Conditions for Fatwa
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c37eda46-ae7d-42df-a335-e0a8e57d5e23
:END:
The conditions for issuing a fatwa are crucial for ensuring the validity and appropriateness of the legal ruling. Here are the specified conditions:
1. Occurrence of the Incident: The incident or matter in questions must have actually taken place. If there is no occurrence of the incident, then issuing a fatwa is not obligatory. However, if the question is asked for the purpose of seeking knowledge, it is obligatory to answer truthfully whenever it is asked, regardless of the circumstance. 
2. Intentions of the Questioner: It is necessary that the intention of the questioner are not malicious or aimed at causing discord among scholars or seeking an excuse for Wrongdoing. If the questioner's intuitions are found to be harmful or hishonest, then it is not obligatory to provide a fatwa.
3. Avoidance of Harm: if issuing a fatwa would lead to greater harm or negative consequence, it is imperative to withhold from issuing a ruling. In such cases, avoiding the greater harm takes precedence over issuing a fatwa.

(Adhering to these condition ensures that fatwas are issued responsibly and in accordance with Islamic principles, safeguarding the integrity of the fatwa process and promoting justice and well-being in society)
** What the questioner is obliged to do
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cb999388-d971-477e-b080-b73452e4a12f
:END:
The obligation of the questioner is seeking a fatwa are essential for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the fatwa process. Here are the two requirements for the questioners:

1. Seeking the Truth and Acting Upon It: The questioner must seek the truth through his questioning and be willing to act upon the fatwa provided. This means that the questioner should not have ulterior motives or seek a specific fatwa that aligns with their desires. Instead, they should genuinely seek guidance in accordance with Islamic principles and be prepared to follow the guidance provided.
2. Selecting an Appropriate Mufti: The questioner should choose a mufti whom they believe to be knowledgeable and pious, capable of providing a reliable fatwa. It is important to select a mufti who is well-versed in Islamic jurisprudence and possesses sound religious knowledge. Selecting the most knowledgeable and pious mufti available is considered obligatory by some scholars, highlighting the importance of choosing the right individual to seek guidance from.

 (By adhering to these obligation, the questioner contributes to the integrity and effectiveness of the fatwa process, ensuring that they receive sound guidance in matters of religious significance)
* Al Ijtihad
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0aaa5bde-6955-44b2-ac08-6ac3ed15f329
:END:
Linguistically: exerting full effort to comprehend a complex matter
Technically: To make an effort to understand a legal ruling
The Mujtahid: The individual who dedicates themselves to the endeavour, striving to expert their utmost effort in understanding and deriving legal rulings in accordance with Islamic jurisprudence.

Ijthad is a crucial concept in Islamic jurisprudence, requiring specific conditions to be met by the Muijtahid, or the individual exerting effort to understand legal rulings. Here are the conditions of Ijtihad:
1. Knowledge of Legal Evidence: The mujtahid must possess a deep understanding of the legal evidences relevant to the issue at hand, including Quranic verse and relevant narrations
2. Expertise in Hadith Science: It is essential for the Mujtahid to be knowledgeable about the authenticity and weaknesses of hadith, including understanding the chains of narrations and assessing the reliability of narrators.
3. Understanding of Abrogation and Consensus: The Mujtahid should be familiar with the concept of abrogation in Islamic La, as well as instance of concensus among scholars, to ensure that their rulings do not contradict established principles
4. Awareness of Legal Terminology: Knowledge of legal terminology and principle of Islamic jurisprudence is necessary for the Mujtahid to interpret text accurately. This includes understanding terms like 'Am (general), Khas (specific), Mutlaq (absolute), Muqayyid (restricted), Mujmal (ambiguous), Mubayyin (clear), among others
5. Ability to Derive Rulings: The Mujtahid must possess the capability to derive legal rulings form the available evidence, applying sound reasoning and methodology in their analysis.
Ijtihad can be categorised based on the scope of the issue being addressed, whether it pertains to a specific chapter of Islamic law or particular legal problem. By meeting these conditions, the Mujtahid is able to engage in the process of Ijtihad effectively, contributing to the development and application of Islamic jurisprudence.

** What is necessary for the Mujtahid
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       726d1ca4-ef49-4731-a3b4-942e7e46c849
:END:
The Mustahid is required to exert diligent effort in seeking the truth. If he arrives at a correct ruling, her earns two rewards: one for his effort and another for reaching the truth. However, if he make an error despite this sincere efforts, he still receives a reward, and his mistake is forgiven. As the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said "When a judge give a ruling and he tries his best (to find the truth) then he gets it receives he has two rewards, and if he judges and gets it wrong then he has only one reward"

If a ruling remains unclear to him, it is permissible for him to refrain from issuing a judgement and instead resort to blind following due to the necessity of the situation.

* Blind Following (Taqlid)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       59787e0b-cca2-480b-8944-9858f2aed358
:END:
Linguistically: refers to encircling or encompassing something like a rope around the neck.
Technically: it means to follow the statements of someone whose words are not considered evidence.

It's important to note that when we say "Whose statements are not evidence", we are excluding following the Prophet (ﷺ), following the concensus of scholars, and the following the statement of the Companions. Following these sources is not considered taqlid because they are considered evidence in themselves. 

However the term taqlid is sometime used figuratively and more broadly to include following these source for the sake of clarity and inclusiveness

** Situations of Taqlid
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c38175a8-5e1b-4308-89a0-a24ffe860613
:END:
Taqlid can occur in two main situations:

For the Common Person: When an individual lack the ability to determine legal rulings independently, they are obligated to engage in blind following. This obligation arises from the Quranic injunction:
"Ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know" 16:43
In this case, the individual should follow the most knowledgeable and pious scholar available to them. If multiple scholars are of equal standing, the individual may choose any of them.

From the Mujtahid: Even a qualified scholars may sometimes encounter a situation requiring an immediate responce, without the opportunity to research the matter thoroughly. In such instances, the scholar may engage in blind following temporarily. some scholars have suggested that blind following should not extend to matters of belief, as certainty is required in matters of faith.

However, the more widely accepted view is that this is not a condition, as the Quranic directive to seek guidance from knowledgeable individuals applies universally. The verse "Ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know" 16:43 is general and encompasses all aspects of religious knowledge, including matters of belief. If a person is unable to arrive at the truth through their own efforts, they are obligated to resort to blind following, as Allah commands believer
"Fear Allah as much as you are able" 64:16

** Types of Taqlid
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c53938ca-ad18-46b0-94fe-4b4a4bf9f7b9
:END:
Blind following can be categorised into two types: general and specific
1. General Blind Following: in this type, an individual adheres to a particular school of thought and follows its rulings and decisions in all matters of religions. Scholars have differed in their opinions regarding the obligation or permissibility of general blind follwing. Some argue that it is obligatory due to the lack of ability for independent reasoning (Ijtihad) among latter generations Other contend that it is forbidden as it involves following someone other than the Prophet (ﷺ) without restriction.

   Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah said: "The statement that it is obligatory to obey someone other than the Prophet (ﷺ) in all commands and prohibitions, is against the consensus, and its permissibility is what it is." And he said: "Whoever adheres to a particular school of though then he opposes it not out of blind following another scholar that has given him a fatwa, not using a evidence that necessitates that or without a legal excuse which he requires a solution for what he has done then he is a follower of his desires, a doer of something forbidden without a legal excuses this is evil; as someonething becomes clear to him which gives preference to one saying over another either by detailed evidence if he know them and understand them, or he see one of two men more knowledgeable than the other and more pious in what he say so he can return from one saying to another the like of this is permissible rather obligatory and Iman Ahmad has written about this"
   
2. Specific Blind Following. In this type an individual only follows the ruling of a particular scholar or school of though in a specific case. This is permissible if the person is unable to arrive at the truth thought their own Ijtihad, either due to genuine inability or because doing so would entail significant hardship.

** Blind following of Fatwas

Allah says:
"Ask the people of the Remembrance if you do not know" 16:43

And the people of the Reminder are the scholars, and the blind follower are not from the people of knowledge who are followed, rather they are followers of others.
Abu 'Umar bin Abdul-barr and other said: "The people are unanimously agreed that the blind follower is not of the scholars, and that knowledge is to know the truth with its evidence." ibn al Qayim said "This is as Abu Umar said: the people do not disagree that knowledge is obtained from the evidence, as for without the evidence then this is blind following" then ibn al Qayim mentioned the permissibility of the fatwa through blind following according to three sayings:

1. it is impermissible to issue fatwas through blind following, as it lack true knowledge, a sentiment shared by most companions and the majority of the Shafi'yah
2. it is permissible for an individual to follow a fatwa thorough blind following for himself, but it is impermissible to blindly follow others'fatwas intended for themselves
3. blind following of fatwas is permissible when necessary and in the absence of a qualified Mujtahid scholar, a view deemed most correct and worthy of implemention.
   
And with this we complete what we intended to write in this concise reminder, we ask Allah to inspire us towards righteousness in speech and action and to crown our actions with success.

Indeed, He is the Most Generous, and blessing sand peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family.
