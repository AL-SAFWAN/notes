4. Summary

* Introduction – The clarity & obscurity of words
Legislation is conveyed through words and phrases directed at those who are
obligated to follow it.

Divine legislation may come through:
- *Literal revelation*: the Qur’an
- *Conceptual revelation*: the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ

Sometimes these words are:
- clear in meaning and intent to the listener or reader,
- and at other times ambiguous or obscure.

This is where *Usul al-Fiqh* becomes critical. It sets principles and
guidelines to:
- discern the Legislator’s intent from the text,
- and determine the rulings that must be implemented.

* Main categorisation – The clear and the obscure
Words, in terms of clarity or obscurity of their meaning, are divided into two
main categories:

1. *Words with clear indication*
   - Do *not* need external clarification to know the intended meaning or how
     to apply them.
2. *Words with ambiguous indication*
   - *Do* need external clarification to know the intended meaning or how to
     apply them.

In other words, the distinction depends on whether the word itself conveys its
intended meaning independently, or whether it requires external context.

** Map of the types - the clear and obsecure
- *Words with clear indication*:
  - *Nass* (النص)
    - The meaning is indicated with *absolute clarity*.
  - *Dhāhir* (الظاهر)
    - One of the possible meanings is more probable.
  - *Mu’awwal* (المؤول)
    - The less probable meaning, taken with evidence.

- *Words with ambiguous indication*:
  - *Mujmal* (المجمل)
    - None of the meanings are more probable than the others, but it *can* be
      clarified.
  - *Mutashābih* (المتشابه)
    - None of the meanings are more probable than the others, and it *cannot*
      be clarified (for us).

* An-Nass –
lnng- apparent (al kash) and revealed 
tech- The text of absolute clarity
** Definition
/Nass/ is:
- “That which indicates its meaning with absolute clarity, *leaving no room
  for any other interpretation*.”
  - no taweel
    
** Examples
- His saying, the Exalted:
  - =قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ=  ‏‎(Al-Ikhlāṣ: 1)
  - “Say, ‘He is Allah, [who is] One.’”
    - you can't interpret anything else from it other than what is says
      - 
- His saying, the Exalted:
  - =مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ ٱللَّهِ=  ‏‎(Al-Fatḥ: 29)
  - “Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.”

e.g flog them 80 times in fiqh
- there nothing else from here,

** Ruling
- Its meaning must be acted upon with *certainty*.
- It is *not permissible* to deviate from it, *except* through
  *abrogation* (naskh).

* Adh-Dhāhir –
ling - the oppiste of what is inside/hiden, something that is becomes clear/exposed
tech: The apparent text
** Definition
/Dhāhir/ is:
- “That which has two possible meanings, with *one of them being more
  apparent*.”
  - 2 words, 1 meaning of them can be more possible and then other 

** Examples
- The indication of a *command* (الأمر) for *obligation*, while it can also
  possibly indicate *recommendation*.
- The indication of a *prohibition* (النهي) for *prohibition* (taḥrīm), while
  it can also possibly indicate *dislike* (karāhah).

Examples from the sayings of the Prophet ﷺ:
- “Pray as you have seen me pray.”  
  (Agreed upon)
  - commanded, but connect with other meanings
    - it possible to have other meaning here
      - one stick out
        - this mean adh dhair text
          - it may suggest recommedn and permissible, even when it comes as a command
- “Do not sell what you do not have.”  
  (Narrated by Aḥmad and the authors of the Sunan)
  - don't sell has 3 possible meaning
    - if you prohibit the default is prohib unless you have something else 
- when you have a general term, its is understood as the general term, but there may be many different forms of that general term which may not be apprent.
  - the scholars say it is wajib to act on the apprent meaning unless you have a valid reason to not to.
    - e.g what we learned from before in terms of the signs and idication  
** Ruling
- It is *obligatory* to act upon the *apparent* meaning.
- Deviation from it is *not permissible* except through:
  - a *valid interpretation* (*ta’wīl*),
  - which is supported by contextual indication or evidence.

* Al-Mu’awwal
lingist meanign- what is this 
– The interpreted text
** Definition
/Mu’awwal/ is:
- “A term that carries a *less likely* meaning which is taken *because of
  supporting evidence*.”
  - not the more apprent, but less lieky if it supported by evidence
    
** Ta’wīl – types of interpretation
1. *Valid interpretation* (التأويل الصحيح)
   - Assigning a word to a less obvious meaning *with strong evidence* that
     necessitates this interpretation.
   - Example:
     - Allah says:
       - In Al-Mā’idah: 3, “blood” is mentioned in a general form.
       - In Al-An‘ām: 145, the “blood” is specified as *flowing blood*.
    - A general word could, in principle, include animals of the land, sky, and sea.
      - Other clear texts show that sea creatures (fish) are permissible, so the general wording cannot be understood to include them.
        - The same applies to locusts, which are explicitly exempted in other texts.
          - Therefore, scholars reduce the scope of the general term so that it excludes fish and locusts, keeping the prohibition only for the remaining animals.
            - This targeted restriction, based on other evidences, is an example of valid interpretation

1. *Invalid interpretation* (التأويل الفاسد)
   - Assigning a word to a less obvious meaning, supported only by *weak*
     evidence that is not strong enough to divert it from its apparent
     meaning.
   - Example:
     - The ḥadīth:  
       “Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardian, her
       marriage is invalid.”
       (Narrated by Aḥmad, Abū Dāwūd and al-Tirmidhī)
     - Some interpreted this as applying *only* to a minor, a slave woman or a
       freed slave woman, but there is insufficient evidence to restrict it
       in that way.
       - all types of women, but they assigned something with no evidence
         
** Conditions for *permissible* ta’wīl

when it can be  ta'will made?
For an interpretation to be valid, the following conditions must be met:


1. The word must be *capable* of being interpreted.
   - the actual word itself 
2. The ta’wīl must be based on *valid evidence* indicating a shift from the
   apparent meaning to another meaning.
   - there must be an evidence in quran and sunnah for this
     - like the example fo the blood 
3. The word being interpreted must be able to *bear* the intended meaning,
   even if it is a less likely possibility.
   - other words, the Arabic language itself must recognise this as a valid possible meaning of the word.
     - If the language does not allow this meaning, then the interpretation is invalid, even if someone claims it fits.
     - Example:Allah says: “Ḥurrimat ʿalaykum al-maytatu…” – “Forbidden to you is al-maytah (dead meat)…”
       - Some might falsely claim that al-maytah here means “dead human beings,” and then argue that this allows eating humans.
         - But in Arabic usage (and in the shar‘ī usage of the fuqahā’), al-maytah refers to the carcass of an animal that died without proper slaughter – not human flesh.
           - Since the word does not bear the meaning of “humans” in this context, such an interpretation is invalid and counted as false ta’wīl (تأويل فاسد).
4. The one performing ta’wīl must possess sufficient qualifications for
   *ijtihād* (independent legal reasoning).
   - the laws and principle

** Ruling on taking the mu’awwal meaning
1. *With evidence*:
   - If there is valid evidence (strong proof, argument, or established
     interpretation from Qur’an, Sunnah, or consensus), it is *permissible*
     to adopt the mu’awwal meaning.
     - the evidenc justify it 
   - The evidence justifies moving from the apparent meaning to the
     interpreted meaning.

2. *Without evidence*:
   - If there is *no* valid evidence, it is *not permissible* to adopt the
     mu’awwal meaning.
   - In this case, the *original apparent meaning* must be followed.
   - Otherwise, it becomes an incorrect approach that may lead to
     misinterpretation or misapplication of the text.
- these are  rules all above are that will give us the abolute rule and how we should go about them using the rules and regualtion
  
* Al-Mujmal –
ling The obscure / ambiguous text
** Definition
/Mujmal/ is:
- “That which indicates *one of multiple meanings*, with *no preference* for
  any of them in relation to the context.”
  
  - not clear which they indicate so you don't know how to apply it
    - widom is to test the people to see if they follow them or not

        e.g nikhah
        after 3 divorce ( you can't come to back it ) 
        1 mean - marriage with nikkah
        2 mean - marraige with constumation
        - in the sunnah we now it mean consumation
          - e.g. people will say no but in the quran it say this and that and interpreted wrong
            - so Allah test them to see what they view

              
** Types of mujmal texts and examples
1. *The polyseme* (المشترك)
   - A word that has been assigned in the language to *two different literal
     meanings*.
   - Example:
     - In the verse about waiting periods:  
       =ثَلَاثَةَ قُرُوءٍ=  
       The word *qurūʾ* may mean:
       - *menstrual cycles* (ḥayḍ), or
       - *periods of purity* (ṭuhr).
     - Both are valid literal meanings.
2. *Legal terms* (الألفاظ الشرعية)
   - Arabic words that, over time, have acquired *specific technical
     meanings* in Sharīʿah.
   - Examples: ṣalāh, zakāh, ḥajj, wuḍūʾ, etc.
     - make wudo (tawadu) when you have the meat of camels
       - does this wudo means to wash our mouth or to make a wudo
         - hence 3 of the madhab says you don't need to make wudo
3. *Actions of the Messenger ﷺ*
   - At times, an action of the Prophet ﷺ may carry *two possible meanings*.
   - The action remains ambiguous until evidence clarifies which meaning is
     intended.
     - when one break the fast to make kafara for 60 days
       - so someone broken their fast during ramandan
         - so does this mean the same hadith applies here
           - this kafara means relations with ones wife, not brekaing by food or other stuff
4. *Metaphor* (المجاز)
   - When a word is no longer taken literally and is *open to multiple
     figurative senses*.
   - None of these figurative meanings are to be preferred without evidence.
   - Example:
     - The ḥadīth:  
       “There is no prayer without the opening of the Book.” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim)
       - “Opening of the Book” is figuratively understood as *reciting
         al-Fātiḥah*.

** Ruling
- The ruling regarding *mujmal* text is to *wait for external clarification*.
- It is *not permissible* to act upon any of its possible meanings *without
  proof*, because:
  - the word itself does not give clear guidance on the intended meaning,
  - and it is not permissible to impose obligations without evidence.

* Al-Bayān
ling– The clarifying text
** tech Definition
/Bayān/ is:
- “The process of removing something from the realm of ambiguity and
  confusion into the realm of clarity and understanding.”
 - this the text that is what make the mujmal text clear
   - grants use understanding
the mesenger was sent to make it clarifying to us, hence he was sent
 - so we're able to figure things out from the quran
   - e.g how the prefrom the ibadah
   - this was the role of the prophet (ﷺ), the quran has stated and the prophet (ﷺ) to show it/explain it - the forms of clarifaction are below      
       
** Ranks / forms of clarification
what consittues as evidence for the al mujmal terms:
1. Statements (qawl)
   - Qur'an and Sunnah
2. Actions (fiʿl)
   - action of the prohet (ﷺ) has claried the mujmal
   - how to preform the Salah
3. Writings
   - the writing of the messenger, those poeple who wrote for them
     it contained the details of inherance and another example had the details of zakat 
4. Tacit approvals (taqrīr)
   - eg staying silient
5. Signs
   - show signed with his hands
     - expalin by the comanions 
6. Indications
   - a reason for an action to be haram or halal  
     - the indication of the ruling, why Allah (ﷺ) has done something
7. Abandonment (ترك)
   - commanded something, then been abroagate or recoomended after 
8. Consensus of the Companions
   - all agreed to the matter
     - the shahaba explained
9. Ijtihād
   - analsing the evdience of the shira

** Delaying clarification (تأخير البيان)
- It is *obligatory* for the Prophet ﷺ to clarify speech *before the time of
  need*.
- Ibn al-Samʿānī reported a *consensus* on the *prohibition* of delaying clarification beyond the time of need.
  - the prophet (ﷺ) said 2 by 2 to a beduon man (who was in hajar/rush )
    - another narration of aisha to say he (ﷺ)  prayed to 8
      - so it's not haram to prayer more than 8   

* Al-Mutashābih –
ling - The absolutely ambiguous text
** tech -Definition
/Mutashābih/ refers to:
- That which has an unclear meaning, where:
  - the intended meaning is *not apparent*,
  - and *Allah alone* knows its true interpretation,
  - and He has *not revealed* it to any of His creation.

It is used for matters where there is *no hope of knowing* the intended
meaning for those who find it ambiguous.

** Example
- The *nature of the attributes of Allah*:
  - the face of Allah
    - we believe it, but its realidy we don't know
      - the shair'a tell us not to ask how
        - to ask how is bidah, e.ge what imaam malik said
  - We understand the *essence* of the attribute (e.g. knowledge, power),
  - but the *specific manner / how* of these attributes remains unknown and
    ambiguous to us.

** Ruling
- The ruling concerning mutashābih texts is:
  - to *believe* in them as *true*,
  - to have *īmān* in what Allah and His Messenger ﷺ intended by them,
  - and to *refrain* from pursuing their exact detailed meaning,
  - because knowing their precise reality is *impossible* for us.

* Closing
May Allah grant you success in this life and the next. *Āmīn.*
