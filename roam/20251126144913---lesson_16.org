  1. قول الصحابي – the statement of a Companion
  2. الاستحسان – al-Istiḥsān (juristic preference)
  3. المصلحة المرسلة – al-Maṣlaḥah al-Mursalah (unrestricted public interest)
  4. شرع من قبلنا – the law of previous nations

- Statement of Imām al-Shāfi‘ī:
  - «وَجْهَةُ العِلْمِ: في الكتاب، أو السنَّة، أو الإجماع، أو القياس»
  - “The foundation of knowledge is: a report from the Book, or the Sunnah, or consensus, or analogy.”

* Evidence (1) – al-Kitāb: The Qur’an
** Three main topics regarding the Qur’an
1. *First topic*:
   - Definition of the Qur’an.
   - Compilation and preservation of the Qur’an.

2. *Second topic*:
   - The authority and miraculous nature of the Qur’an.
   - The authoritativeness of *al-qirā’ah ash-shādhah*.
   - Types of *aḥkām* (rulings) in the Qur’an.

3. *Third topic*:
   - The method of deriving rulings from the Qur’an.

(This lesson focuses on the types of rulings, their presentation and indication, and the role of Qirā’āt.)

* The categories of rulings in the Qur’an
** 1. Doctrinal rulings – أحكام اعتقادية
- Beliefs related to:
  - Allah,
  - His angels,
  - His books,
  - His messengers,
  - the Last Day,
  - and divine decree (al-qadar).

** 2. Ethical rulings – أحكام أخلاقية
- Morals and character traits a Muslim must adopt:
  - justice (العدل),
  - iḥsān (الإحسان),
  - truthfulness,
  - patience,
  - etc.

** 3. Practical rulings – أحكام عملية
Divided into two broad areas:

1. *Acts of worship* – أحكام العبادات
   - Rules for:
     - ṣalāh (prayer),
     - ṣawm (fasting),
     - zakāh,
     - ḥajj,
     - and other devotional acts.

2. *Social and civil transactions* – أحكام المعاملات
   - Cover:
     - personal status (marriage, divorce, inheritance),
     - financial and commercial dealings (sales, contracts, partnerships),
     - criminal law (ḥudūd, qiṣāṣ, ta‘zīr),
     - judicial procedures and court rulings.

* The Qur’an’s manner of presenting rulings
** 1. Detailed elucidation of certain rulings
Some areas are explained with extensive detail and near-completeness, for example:

- Doctrinal matters:
  - many verses clarify belief in Allah, His oneness, attributes, signs, and proofs,
  - and refute false creeds.
- Inheritance rules:
  - portions and shares are laid out with precision.
- Many family-law issues.
- Ḥudūd punishments and expiations (kaffārāt).

** 2. General clarification of many other legal rulings
Other rulings are mentioned in *general* terms without detailed pillars and conditions, such as:

- Commands to:
  - pray,
  - give zakāh,
  - fast Ramaḍān,
  - perform ḥajj.
  - The specifics of performance are clarified by the Sunnah.
- Civil, international, criminal, constitutional and similar matters:
  - the Qur’an gives broad principles and foundations,
  - while detailed applications are derived from Sunnah, ijmā‘, qiyās, and ijtihād.

** 3. The Qur’an as foundation for supplementary sources
- The Qur’an explicitly *refers* to and *authorises* other sources of Sharī‘ah, such as:
  - the Sunnah,
  - ijmā‘,
  - qiyās,
  - and additional uṣūlī evidences.
- It does this by:
  - commanding obedience to the Messenger ﷺ,
  - praising those who refer disputes to Allah and His Messenger,
  - and encouraging reflection and reasoning.
- Thus the Qur’an encompasses all rulings either:
  - *in detail*,
  - *in summary*,
  - or *by reference* to these supplementary sources.

* The Qur’an’s indication of legal rulings
The *text* of the Qur’an is certain (qaṭ‘iyy al-thubūt) due to tawātur transmission.  
The *indication* of its verses towards particular rulings, however, can be:

** 1. Definitive indication – قطعي الدلالة
- A verse is *qaṭ‘iyy al-dalālah* when it can only carry *one* clear meaning with no plausible alternative.
- Example:
  - Inheritance shares in Sūrat al-Nisāʾ (4:11–12):
    - portions for children, spouses, etc., are expressed in unambiguous numerical terms.
- Rulings based on such verses are *certain* and not open to ijtihād on the level of meaning.

** 2. Probable indication – ظني الدلالة
- A verse is *ẓanniyy al-dalālah* when:
  1. Its wording supports more than one possible meaning; or
  2. There is some ambiguity that allows for differing interpretations.
- Example:
  - The word *«قروء»* in:
    - =وَالْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَاثَةَ قُرُوءٍ= (al-Baqarah 2:228)
  - *Qurūʾ* can linguistically mean:
    - menstrual cycles (ḥayḍ),
    - or periods of purity (ṭuhr).
- Here the Sunnah and the practice of the Companions clarify which meaning is intended.
- Rulings derived from such verses involve *ijtihād* and may differ between jurists.

* Defining al-Qirā’āt (القراءات)
** Definition
«عِلْمٌ يُعْرَفُ بِهِ كَيْفِيَّةُ أَدَاءِ كَلِمَاتِ الْقُرْآنِ، وَوُجُوهُهَا اخْتِلَافًا وَاتِّفَاقًا، مَعَ عَزْوِ كُلِّ وُجْهٍ إِلَى نَاقِلِهِ»

- A science by which one comes to know:
  - how the words of the Qur’an are to be recited,
  - the various accepted modes of recitation (agreement and variation),
  - and to which reciter (qāriʾ / rāwī) each mode is attributed.

** The role of Qirā’āt in extracting rulings
- Authentic, divinely-sanctioned Qirā’āt:
  - highlight the *breadth* of a verse’s meaning,
  - may *expand*, *specify* or *nuance* its legal implications.
- By examining multiple Qirā’āt, jurists can:
  - combine and reconcile different shades of meaning,
  - strengthen or clarify rulings,
  - uncover additional dimensions that may not be apparent in a single reading.

* Examples – Qirā’āt and legal rulings
** Example 1 – Approaching wives during menstruation
- Verse: =فَاعْتَزِلُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي الْمَحِيضِ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ ...= (al-Baqarah 2:222)

- Variant readings of *«حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ»*:
  1. *yaṭhurna* (يَطْهُرْنَ):
     - read by Nāfiʿ, Abū ʿAmr, Ibn Kathīr, Ibn ʿĀmir, and ʿĀṣim (Ḥafṣ),
     - indicates the *natural cessation* of bleeding.
  2. *yatṭahharna* (يَتَطَهَّرْنَ):
     - read by Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʾī, ʿĀṣim (Abū Bakr), and al-Mufaḍḍal,
     - implies *ritual purification* by ghusl.

- Combined ruling:
  - Lawful intimacy returns only when:
    1. the bleeding has *stopped*; and
    2. the woman has performed *ghusl*.

** Example 2 – Ruling on the feet in wuḍūʾ
- Verse: =يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ ... وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ= (al-Māʾidah 5:6)

- Variant readings of *«وأرجلكم»*:
  1. *wa-arjulakum* (وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ) with fatḥah:
     - read by Nāfiʿ, Ibn ʿĀmir, al-Kisāʾī, etc.,
     - grammatically linked to *“faghsilū”* → implies *washing* the feet.
  2. *wa-arjulikum* (وَأَرْجُلِكُمْ) with kasrah:
     - read by al-Ḥasan, al-Aʿmash and others,
     - in structure tied to *“wamsaḥū”* → suggests *wiping*.

- Combined understanding:
  - The Qur’an legislates:
    - *washing* the feet in normal wuḍūʾ,
    - *wiping* over leather socks (khuffayn) or in specific circumstances,
  - and the Qirā’āt help support both aspects.

* Defining al-Qirā’ah ash-Shādhah (القراءة الشاذة)
** Definition
«القراءة التي صح سندها ووافقت اللغة العربية ولو بوجه وخالفت المصحف»

- A recitation:
  - whose chain of transmission is *authentic*,
  - which conforms to Arabic language (in at least one recognised way),
  - but *does not conform* to the rasm (consonantal outline) of the ʿUthmānic muṣḥaf.

** Comparison – Mutawātir vs Shādh Qirā’āt
- *Qirā’ah Mutawātirah*:
  - Chain: mass-transmitted (tawātur).
  - Matches: Arabic language.
  - Agrees with: ʿUthmānic muṣḥaf.
  - Use in ṣalāh: recitation is *permissible* and valid.
  - Use in deriving rulings: *authoritative* proof.

- *Qirā’ah Shādhah*:
  - Chain: sound but *not* mutawātir.
  - Matches: Arabic language.
  - Differs from: ʿUthmānic muṣḥaf.
  - Use in ṣalāh: *not permissible* as Qur’ān.
  - Use in deriving rulings: *subject of disagreement* among scholars.

* Ruling on using al-Qirā’ah ash-Shādhah as evidence
** First opinion – Authoritative
- Attributed to:
  - Abū Ḥanīfah, Aḥmad, and many of their followers.
- Reasoning:
  - These readings are transmitted from the Prophet ﷺ with *sound* chains.
  - They are either:
    - part of the aḥruf whose written form was later left, or
    - Prophetic Sunnah in wording.
  - In both cases, they represent *revelation* with legal weight.
- Therefore:
  - they may be used as *supporting evidence* in deriving rulings.

** Second opinion – Not authoritative
- Held by:
  - Imām Mālik, the well-known view of Imām al-Shāfiʿī, and others.
- Reasoning:
  - The Companions transmitted them as *Qur’an*, not as Sunnah.
  - Anything that does not meet the conditions of Qur’ān (mutawātir + agreement with muṣḥaf)
    - cannot be treated as Qur’ān.
  - They are likely:
    - individual *ijtihād* or explanatory readings of some Companions.
  - The opinion of a Companion, while respected, is *not binding* as proof.
- Therefore:
  - such readings are *not* used as independent legal evidence,
  - though they may still be cited as *explanatory* or *supportive* material.

* Examples – Shādh Qirā’āt and legal effects
** Example 1 – Expiation for broken oaths
- Verse: Sūrat al-Māʾidah 5:89  
  - Mentions feeding, clothing or freeing a slave as expiation,
  - then: fasting *three days* for the one who cannot afford that.

- ʿAbdullāh ibn Masʿūd’s shādh recitation adds:
  - «فَصِيَامُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ مُتَتَابِعَاتٍ»
  - “…then he must fast *three consecutive days*.”

- Resulting fiqh difference:
  - Those who accept shādh readings as proof:
    - require the fasting to be *consecutive*.
  - Those who do not:
    - hold that three days of fasting are required,
    - but not necessarily consecutively, as the standard muṣḥaf reading is silent on continuity.

** Example 2 – Inheritance of maternal siblings
- Verse: Sūrat al-Nisāʾ 4:12  
  - =وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ كَلَالَةً أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا السُّدُسُ=
  - Speaks of a man or woman leaving *kalālah* with a brother or sister receiving one-sixth.

- Saʿd ibn Abī Waqqāṣ’s shādh recitation adds:
  - «وله أخ أو أخت من أم»
  - “…and he has a brother or sister *from his mother*.”

- Legal effect:
  - This clarifies that the siblings in this verse are *maternal* half-siblings.
  - Based on this explanatory reading:
    - scholars agreed that:
      - a single maternal sibling receives one-sixth,
      - multiple maternal siblings share one-third.
  - Here the shādh recitation *explains and specifies* what is already understood from context and other evidences.

* Exercise
- Review the examples of Qirā’āt and:
  - identify which rulings are based on *mutawātir* readings,
  - which rulings gain *additional detail* from shādh recitations,
  - and how jurists reconcile them with the ʿUthmānic muṣḥaf.

* Closing – Importance of studying Usul al-Fiqh
- Imām al-Qarāfī said:
  - “Whoever does not study uṣūl al-fiqh is prevented from issuing fatwā,
    because he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts,
    nor how to restrict and specify general directives.”

* Duʿāʾ
May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and the seal of the Prophets, Muḥammad,
his Companions and all those who follow his way. *Āmīn.*
