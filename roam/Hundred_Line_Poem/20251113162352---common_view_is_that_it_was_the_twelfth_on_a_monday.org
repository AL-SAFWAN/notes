#+title: common view is that it was the twelfth on a Monday

  
There is a hadith in a sahih Muslim, that [[id:40d25cc3-5bd0-4cce-a2b6-4176fcafc2d0][his birth is on a Monday]], so he fast in gratitude in Allah.
- there is no concrete evidence , some day the 1st Monday and some say the other 
- The benefit of this, is that if it was spacial and single it out for worship the sahabah would have preserved it. 
- As the date itself is not know, hence there not act on doing anything to that day specifically
