** The Kaʿbah and its foundations

:ID:       ebdda0fe-7140-442b-919d-b235bb0370eb
:END:
Allah decreed for *Ibrahim and his son Ismail to raise the foundations of the Kaʿbah*.
Some tafsir mention that the original foundations existed before Ibrahim, either, from Ādam or by the angels — and that Ibrahim rebuilt it upon these foundations.

** The Arabs and the Hajj before Islam
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       010b65f7-de72-4f21-9bbb-0ec2198b60e5
:END:

Although Quraysh and the Arab tribes committed shirk, they still *preserved* many rituals of Ibrahim, including:
- ṭawaf around the Kaʿbah
- honouring of the sacred months
- serving the pilgrims
- visiting Makkah during the months of Hajj

During the Hajj season, tribes from all over Arabia would come to Makkah, and the merchants of Quraysh would *raise their prices*.
This made Quraysh *wealthy* and gave them *prestige* as servants of the House of Allah.

** Abraha’s envy
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3802beea-c713-4f8e-a9ba-20e44d27fc6f
:END:
There was a man from Yemen named *[[id:c1d070c6-3c2f-4ea1-9868-c41e953cf2f0][Abraha al-Ashram]]*, the Abyssinian governor under the Christian kingdom.
He became jealous of the honour and wealth Quraysh gained during the pilgrimage season.

He gathered the Christians and said:
 #+begin_quote
  I will build for you a magnificent church so that people from all regions come to visit it instead of the Kaʿbah.
 #+end_quote

So he constructed a massive cathedral in sana, called al-Qullays, the tallest and most decorated building in Arabia at that time.
He announced that he intended to divert the Arab pilgrimage to his church, claiming:
 #+begin_quote
  Are we not the true followers of Ibrāhīm and of ʿisa?
  Why should they make pilgrimage to the land of idol-worshippers?
 #+end_quote

He wrote to the surrounding kings instructing them to send their pilgrims to this church.
He also publicly declared his intention to destroy the Kaʿbah.

** The Arabs respond

:END:
When the Arab tribes heard what Abraha planned, they were enraged.
A man from the tribe of Kinanah, named [[id:3a4aa9f1-b8bd-4e15-920f-f7db047ef3ef][Ibn Nadir]] (mentioned in early sirah accounts), travelled to al-Qullays and defecated inside the church, showing contempt for Abraha’s attempt to replace the Kaʿbah.

When Abraha heard this, he said:
 #+begin_quote
  How dare they defile this sacred place!
  I will march against them with an army and destroy their House.
 #+end_quote
He began preparing an army, including war elephants.

** Abraha assembles his army

Abraha sought assistance from Christian kingdoms across the region.
They sent soldiers, weapons, and support.
Abraha marched with a huge army accompanied by elephants, the most famous of which in narrations is Mahmud, his main elephant.

** Passing through the Arabian tribes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ca8aaea3-6176-44e3-bc91-34c4c1881cfe
:END:

Abraha reached a region called Khathʿam.

Their leader, [[id:8ac3cfa3-dd71-4561-8aca-9d78145ae6ce][Nufayl ibn Habib al-Khathʿami]], tried to mobilise his people to resist, but after seeing the size of the army, he realised they could not fight.

He was captured and initially sentenced to death by the yemeni army, but Abraha spared him and kept him as a guide, forcing him to show the army the route toward Makkah.

** Passing Ta’if
When the army reached Ta’if, the tribe of Thaqif came out to meet Abraha.
They had their own temple, al-Lāt, and they did not respect the Kaʿbah as Quraysh did.
They told Abraha:
 #+begin_quote
  “We are with you.
  We hear and we obey.
  We have no attachment to the Kaʿbah.”
 #+end_quote

One of their men, [[id:9b85a495-d419-4371-8faf-80ebf6fa6a5e][Abu Righal]], guided Abraha’s army to the borders of Makkah, to Mughammas and died there.

The Arabs despised him for helping the destroyer of the Kaʿbah, and classical narrations mention that his grave was stoned for generations as a sign of hatred.

The Arabs hated him for betraying the sanctuary, the made it in a tradition to used to stone his grave, after hajj.

** Abraha in Mughammas

:END:
Abraha sent a group of men from al-Ḥabasha (Abyssinia) ahead of his army to enter Makkah and loot its wealth.

They returned with many valuables, including two hundred camels belonging to [[id:201cf4db-a5d0-4c74-b4eb-0392e00ba953][ʿAbd al-Muttalib]], the grandfather of the Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ).

*** 'Abd al-Muttalib goes to Abraha
Then he heard that his camels had been taken, ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib went to the location of Abraha’s camp.
He was shown Abraha’s large tent and requested permission to enter.

Abraha allowed him in, and they sat together with a translator between them.

ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib said:
  #+begin_quote
   I want you to return my two hundred camels.
  #+end_quote
Abraha said, surprised:
  #+begin_quote
  I am coming to destroy your House (the Kaʿbah) and your religion,
  and you are only talking to me about your camels?
  #+end_quote
ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib replied:
  #+begin_quote
  I am the owner of the camels,
  and this House has a Lord who will protect it.
  #+end_quote
Abraha then told him to leave.
ʿAbd al-Muttalib remained firm and insisted he would not leave except on the condition that his camels were returned to him.
So they returned the camels to him.

Straight after ʿAbd al-Muttalib went directly to the kabah.

Then he pleading to Allah holding the ropes of the kabah, saying:
 #+begin_quote
  O Allah, free Quraysh (from this threat).
  We are only following the sunnah of Ibrahim in honouring this House.
  This is the House which Ibrahim built.
 #+end_quote
 
Then he called all of Quraysh and ordered them to leave Makkah and withdraw to the surrounding hills and high places, and wait for the punishment of Allah to appear and for Allah to protect His House.

The army then tried to march forward with the elephants.

Before they moved, [[id:8ac3cfa3-dd71-4561-8aca-9d78145ae6ce][Nufayl ibn Habib al-Khathʿami]]  came close to the main elephant and said:
 #+begin_quote
  Kneel down and stay where you are!
  Turn back safely to where you came from,
  for you are in the Sacred Land of Allah.
 #+end_quote

When they directed the elephant towards other directions, it would move running.
But when they tried to make it walk towards the Kaʿbah, it refused to move and would kneel and stay fixed to the ground.

Abraha ask [[id:8ac3cfa3-dd71-4561-8aca-9d78145ae6ce][Nufayl ibn Habib al-Khathʿami]] for another way.

Bird (tayr) started to appear in the sky form all directions. The bird carried as ibn abbas mention: 3 stones - beak (1), claws (2) that was in burning.

Every soldier whom a stone struck collapsed and disintegrated, dying immediately. Abraha fled and cried out for Nufayl to guide him back toward Yemen, but Allah destroyed him as he destroyed his entire army.
