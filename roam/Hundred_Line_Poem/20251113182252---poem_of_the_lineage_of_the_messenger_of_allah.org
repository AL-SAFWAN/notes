 (Peace be upon him)
In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful
The fathers of the master of humanity
(Muhammad, peace be upon him) are as
follows:

He (ﷺ) is the son of
1. Abdullah
2. Abdul Muttalib
3. Hashim
4. Abdi Manaf
5. Qusai
6. Kilab
7. Murrah
8. Ka‘b
9. Luai
10. Ghalib
11. Fihr
12. Malik
13. ِNadr 
14. Kinanah
15. Khuzaimah
16. Mudrikah
17. Ilyas
18. Mudar 
19. Nizar
20. Ma‘ad
21. Adnan

And after that the eminent scholars differed 

The differ between Adnan and Ismeal, because the name are non arab name, and call them other name or by nickname, which is common in the arab thought, referring the same person but with a different name. The all agree that he is the progeny of Islmeal, who is the son of Ibrahim, they all agree he is the progeny of Ibrahim and then Nuh, they differ the name in between them. They further agree his (ﷺ) is from the children of sheeth who is the son of Adam, the differ the name between nuh to sheeth.

We learn that muhmammed (ﷺ) linage is to ishmeal -> ibrahim -> nuh -> sheeth - adam
