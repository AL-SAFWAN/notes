intro
the throne 
  - the throne is the largest in size
    - the roof of creation
      - not creation above it, only Allah
        
worship is not worship unless if it is done with tawheed
- a condition of worship is that it is free from shirk

* Introduction

** Opening duʿā’
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.

I ask Allah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Mighty Throne,

*** The Throne
- the Throne is the largest of all created things
  - it is the roof of creation
    - there is no creation above it, only Allah

*** Supplication
- to take charge of you in this world and the Hereafter,
- to make you blessed wherever you may be, and
- to make you among those who:
  - when given, are grateful,
  - when tested, are patient, and
  - when they sin, seek forgiveness.

- Indeed, these three are the markers of happiness.

** Al-Ḥanīfiyyah – the way of Ibrāhīm

Know – may Allah guide you to obey Him – that al-Ḥanīfiyyah, the way of Ibrāhīm, is that you worship Allah alone, making the religion purely for Him.

Allah, the Most High, says:

“I have not created the jinn and humankind except that they worship Me.”  
[adh-Dhāriyāt 51:56]

** Worship and tawheed

So when you know that Allah created you for His worship, then know that worship is not truly called worship except together with tawheed,

- just as the prayer is not called prayer except along with purification.
  - if shirk enters into worship, it spoils it,
    - just as a state of impurity, when it enters into purification, ruins it.
      - e.g. a person still wants to pray whilst in a state of ḥadath (minor/major impurity).

** The danger of shirk

When you know that:
- shirk, if it mixes with worship,
  1. corrupts it,
  2. destroys the deeds, and
  3. makes its doer from those who remain forever in the Fire,
     - never enter Paradise,
       - they have no helpers,
         - no one’s intercession will benefit them,

- then you know that the most important thing upon you is to know this matter,
  - so that Allah may rescue you from this net – the net of associating partners with Allah (shirk) – about which Allah, the Exalted, said:

#+begin_quote
“Indeed, Allah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him, but He forgives whatever is less than that for whom He wills.”  
[an-Nisā’ 4:48]
#+end_quote

*** Major vs minor shirk in this āyah
- Is this referring to minor or major shirk?
  - the majority say it is major shirk and not minor shirk.
  - a minority say it includes both:
    - he will be punished for the minor shirk and then enter into Jannah,
      - e.g. Ibn Taymiyyah (raḥimahullāh).

** The four rules

- This is by knowing four rules which Allah, the Most High, has mentioned in His Book.

* The First Rule

** The tawheed the mushrikīn already accepted

Know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) fought believed that Allah, the Exalted, is:
- the Creator,
- the Provider, and
- the One who manages all affairs.

Yet that did not enter them into Islam.
- the disbelievers believed in tawheed al-rubūbiyyah
  - but it was not sufficient for them to enter into Islam.

The proof is His saying, the Most High:

#+begin_quote
“Say: Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And who directs the affair? They will surely say: ‘Allah.’ So say: Will you not then be mindful (and fear Him)?”  
[Yūnus 10:31]
#+end_quote

- This shows they believed in the Lordship of Allah.
  - they did not believe that their idols created the heavens and the earth
    - rather, they knew that Allah created them.

** What made them disbelievers

- What made them disbelievers?
  - Allah did not send the Prophet (ﷺ) to teach (only) the Lordship (rubūbiyyah),
    - but He used it as the proof to affirm the worship of Allah alone (ulūhiyyah).
      - they knew that “lā ilāha illā Allāh” does not mean “there is no god except Allah” in a vague sense,
        - but that:
          - there is no deity that has the *right* to be worshipped except Allah,
          - and that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah.
      - hence they refused and said:
        - “Has he made all our gods into one God?”


*** Iblīs
- Iblīs *believed* in Allah’s existence and Lordship.
- He *spoke* to Allah and *asked* Him for respite.
- He still became a disbeliever because he **refused to obey** a clear command (prostrating to Ādam).
- His kufr = **arrogant refusal after knowing** (kufr al-ʿinād / al-istikbār).
- ➜ *Lesson*: Knowledge without submission and obedience ≠ īmān.

*** Why their action is shirk (even though they “believe in Allah”)

- They *know* Allah is the only Lord (like Quraysh knew, like Iblīs knew).
- They still **refuse** to restrict worship/duʿā’ to Allah alone.
- They hand over duʿā’, hope, fear, and vows to:
  - a saint,
  - a dead person,
  - an unseen figure.

- This is:
  - **disobedience after knowledge**, and
  - **directing worship to other than Allah**.

- ➜ That is exactly what makes it shirk, even while they verbally say “lā ilāha illā Allāh”.

**** Why they don’t *call* it shirk

- From this we understand what the shirk of Quraysh was in worship.
  - This is why some deviant groups fell into shirk,
    - e.g. asking the dead.
  - they too believe there is “no god except Allah”
    - but if this alone were enough, Quraysh would have been Muslims as well – hence this is incorrect.
      - they say: as long as Allah is the one true Lord, then it is not shirk,
        - such as making duʿā’ to a saint; they say:
          - “it’s not shirk until he is likened to Allah in His Lordship.”
        - however, duʿā’ is ʿibādah (worship),
          - which is an *exclusive* right of Allah,
          - and it is being given to someone who cannot even hear.

*** Changing names but not the reality

- They redefine their act:
  - “This is tawassul, not worship.”
  - “We only honour/love him; we don’t worship.”

- They redefine shirk:
  - “It is only shirk if we believe he creates or provides.”

- They confuse:
  - asking a *living* person next to you to *make duʿā’ for you* (permissible),
  - with *calling directly* upon the unseen or the dead (duʿā’ *to them*).

- They change the **labels**, but the **reality** of the act is duʿā’ to other than Allah.
