#+title: does not sent Salat upon me

The prophet ([[id:57a6968f-c3f5-401f-a9ec-36e89cf264ad][ﷺ]]) said: [[id:00d4b5ff-6fd6-4357-a961-388c8a3c447d][The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned yet does not pray for Allah's blessings upon me.]] and [[id:b1deac9d-5afa-435e-9765-99b8c78a8b79][Do not make your houses graves, and do not make my grave a place of festivity. But invoke blessings on me, for your blessings reach me wherever you may be.]]

  Indeed, Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O  believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace.
