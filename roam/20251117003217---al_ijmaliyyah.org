The term "general" (al-ijmaliyyah) refers to broad principle or rules, exemplified by maxims such as; a command implies an obligation, prohibition implies forbidance, and the validity of a transaction necessitate the execution of action that follow, such as the exchange of goods.


From this definition, we can conclude that specific evidence fall outside the scope of Usul ul Fiqh except when used illustratively to demonstrate a general rule.
