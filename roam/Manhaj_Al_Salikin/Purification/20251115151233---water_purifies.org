#+title: water purifies 

This is the default position unless proven otherwise even if colour, taste or smell changed by something pure. Agreed upon. This water can be used to do wudu or ghusul.

However if the name of the substance changed, it's still pure but can no longer be used for wudo. e.g. tea, flavoured water
