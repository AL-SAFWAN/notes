#+title: I have been given five things no other prophet before me was given
I have been given five things no other prophet before me was given: Allah made me victorious by awe (of frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month’s journey. The earth has been made for me a place of praying and purification. Therefore, one should pray whenever the time of prayer comes. War booty has been made halal for me, which was not allowed for anyone before me. I have been given the shafa’ah (intercession). Each prophet was sent to his nation specifically whereas I have been sent to the whole of mankind
