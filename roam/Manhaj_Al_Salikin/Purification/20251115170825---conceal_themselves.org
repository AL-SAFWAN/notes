#+title: conceal themselves 

You should not relieve themselves in front of people.

The Scholars mention The prophet (ﷺ) use to have a stick/spear for several benefits
1. Beat the floor when urinating
   - so the urine doesn't splash
2. Use it as a sutrah
3. Use it to conceal himself (e.g. holding a cloth) because people relieved themselves in the open
