3. The prophet peace and blessing of Allah be on him, said Islam is build upon five; to bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except of *Allah*, and that *Muhammed* peace and blessing of Allah be on him is the messenger of Allah, establishing the *prayer*, giving *zakah*, making *pilgrimage* to the house and *fasting* Ramadan (Agreed upon)
   
4. As for the declaration of faith i.e to say la ilaha illallah, then this is the knowledge of the servant of Allah and his firm belief and commitment to the fact that no one has the right to be worshipped except Allah
    
   This necessitates upon the servant: sincere devotion to the religion of Allah; that his worship, inner and outer, are all for Allah and that he does not associate with Allah anyone or anything regarding any aspect of the religion. This is the foundation of the religion of the messenger and their followers, as Allah says:

5. The declaration that Muhammad peace and blessing of Allah be on him, is the Messenger of Allah necessitates that the server of Allah firmly believes that Allah sent Muhammed peace and blessing of Allah be on him, to the [[id:f408c489-bd70-44ae-b757-8fc35daf6ae8][taqalayn]] (jinn and mankind) as a giver of glad tiding and as a warner, calling them to single out Allah in worship and to obey him. It also means to believe in his message and applying his command and keeping away from his prohibition. Moreover, it necessitates that one believes that there is no happiness and goodness in this world or the hereafter unless one has faith in him and follows him and that it is an obligation to put the love of him above the love of oneself, children and all of mankind

   it also implies that one believes that Allah provided the prophet with miracles to prove his message; that Allah endowed him with knowledge and noble character; that his religion is one of guidance, mercy and truth; and that it entails both religious and worldly benefits
    
   The greatest sign of Allah is the Qur’an. It embodies the truth in what it relates  as it commandments and prohibitions.
    
   And Allah knows best
