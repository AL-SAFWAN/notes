* [[id:308f745f-1fa6-4464-b510-24e7ec1cb3db][Allah does not oppress anyone]].In hadith qudsi Allah (ﷻ) says:
 #+begin_quote
 I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.
 #+end_quote
Allah (ﷻ) is  the most just, the most gentle, the most generous, extremely generous the one who give in abundance.

Allah lead astray is understood by this, that he chose to leave the Shari'a and Allah let him go completely.
