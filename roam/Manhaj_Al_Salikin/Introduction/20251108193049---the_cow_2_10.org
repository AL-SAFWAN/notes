The Cow (2:10) 
فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌۭ فَزَادَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَرَضًۭا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْذِبُونَ ١٠

In their hearts is disease, so Allāh has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.
— Saheeh International
Footnote - 1
- The "disease" mentioned here includes doubt, hypocrisy, arrogance and disbelief.
