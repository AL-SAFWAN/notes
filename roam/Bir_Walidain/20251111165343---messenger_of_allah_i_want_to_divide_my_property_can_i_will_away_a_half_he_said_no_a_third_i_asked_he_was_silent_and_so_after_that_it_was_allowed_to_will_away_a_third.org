#+title: "Messenger of Allah, I want to divide my property. Can I will away a half?" he said "No" "A third?" I asked. He was silent and so after that it was allowed to will away a third

This ruling came due to Sa'd ibn Abu Waqas, it became permissible for give a 1/3, when the person dies hes allowed to say I want to give a max of 1/3 to someone who doesn't inherent for me.

In another narration it say a third is a lot, and this word that was used was to showed that it was discouraged, and some of the sahaba said you should give 1/4 or 1/5
