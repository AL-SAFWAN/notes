Mary (19:43) 

يَـٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّى قَدْ جَآءَنِى مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَمْ يَأْتِكَ فَٱتَّبِعْنِىٓ أَهْدِكَ صِرَٰطًۭا سَوِيًّۭا ٤٣

O  dear father! I have certainly received some knowledge which you have not received, so follow me and I will guide you to the Straight Path.
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, The Clear Quran


O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.
— Saheeh International
