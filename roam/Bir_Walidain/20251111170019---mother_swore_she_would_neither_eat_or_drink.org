#+title: mother swore she would neither eat or drink

His mother wouldn't eat and drink until he Left Muhammad (ﷺ), this is hard for a child. Then Allah revealed the ayah "But if they try to make you associate Something with Me about which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. Keep company with them correctly and courteously in this world". If this is the case of the parents who are polytheist and forcing you to belief, what about the believe parents who aren't.
