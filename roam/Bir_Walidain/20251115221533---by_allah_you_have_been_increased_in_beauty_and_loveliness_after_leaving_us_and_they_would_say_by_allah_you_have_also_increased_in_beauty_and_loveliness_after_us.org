حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو عُثْمَانَ، سَعِيدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ الْجَبَّارِ الْبَصْرِيُّ حَدَّثَنَا حَمَّادُ بْنُ سَلَمَةَ، عَنْ ثَابِتٍ، الْبُنَانِيِّ عَنْ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ "‏ إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَسُوقًا يَأْتُونَهَا كُلَّ جُمُعَةٍ فَتَهُبُّ رِيحُ الشَّمَالِ فَتَحْثُو فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ وَثِيَابِهِمْ فَيَزْدَادُونَ حُسْنًا وَجَمَالاً فَيَرْجِعُونَ إِلَى أَهْلِيهِمْ وَقَدِ ازْدَادُوا حُسْنًا وَجَمَالاً فَيَقُولُ لَهُمْ أَهْلُوهُمْ وَاللَّهِ لَقَدِ ازْدَدْتُمْ بَعْدَنَا حُسْنًا وَجَمَالاً ‏.‏ فَيَقُولُونَ وَأَنْتُمْ وَاللَّهِ لَقَدِ ازْدَدْتُمْ بَعْدَنَا حُسْنًا وَجَمَالاً ‏"‏ ‏.‏

[[id:685a9a53-941d-46fe-b886-5935bbd43f2a][Anas b. Malik]] reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: In Paradise there is a street to which they would come every Friday. The north wind will blow and would scatter fragrance on their faces and on their clothes and would add to their beauty and loveliness, and then they would go back to their family after having an added lustre to their beauty and loveliness, and their family would say to them: By Allah, you have been increased in beauty and loveliness after leaving us, and they would say: By Allah, you have also increased in beauty and loveliness after us.
