#+title: Literal words (al-haqiqah)

refers to terms used in their primary, original sense, which directly conveys the meaning they are commonly understood to represent.
- Words used for the meaning they have been assigned.
  
For example, "lion" refer to the well know large predatory cat.

 
Literal (al-ḥaqīqī) meanings fall into *three categories*:

* 1. literal linguistics

:END:
This is the original, primary meaning of a word in the language.
- example: "Salah" linguistically means "supplication" or "prayer" in a general sense.
- Excludes:Meanings that come from:
  - Sharʿī (legal) definitions
  - Customary / cultural usage  
  (These can go beyond or differ from the pure language meaning.)
  
* 2. Literal sharia (legislative/technical) words

:END:
These refer to term that have specific meaning as defined by shariah (Islamic law).
- Example:
  "Salah" in a legal context means the formal ritual prayer with specific actions (takir and taslim) and recitations, not dua.

- Excludes:
  - purely linguistic meanings
  - customary meanings
    
* 3. literal customary words
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
these refer to words whose meaning are determined by the customs or social context, that is understood in everyday.
- Example:
  The word "dabah" may be used in some cultures specifically to mean a four-legged animal, even though this is not its strict language definition.

- Excludes:
  - strict linguistic definitions
  - legislative definitions

* Importance of distinguishing the three meanings

Understanding that words have three distinct realities — linguistic, legislative, and customary — provides several benefits:

- Each word is interpreted correctly within its proper context.
- Linguists analyse words according to language norms.
- Jurists interpret terms according to the legal framework.
- People of custom understand words according to cultural usage.
- This awareness improves clarity, prevents misunderstandings, and supports accurate communication.

* Why this matters in deriving rulings
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- If we apply the wrong category (linguistic vs legal vs customary), we may arrive at incorrect rulings.
- The correct meaning depends on context: how the sentence is constructed, what is being discussed, and the intended domain (law, language, or culture).
- Allah taught Adam all the words, indicating that meanings, contexts, and categories are deliberate and foundational.
