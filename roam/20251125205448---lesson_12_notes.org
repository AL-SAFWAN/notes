* Mutlaq & Muqayyad – Introduction
The concepts of **Mutlaq (absolute/unrestricted)** and **Muqayyad (restricted/specified)**  
are foundational tools in deriving rulings.

They help scholars:
- analyse different evidences,
- reconcile unrestricted vs restricted wordings,
- extract precise legal rulings.

* Definitions
** Mutlaq (Absolute / Unrestricted)
Definition:  
"A word that is neither qualified nor conditioned nor limited, and indicates a reality without restriction."

Example:  
- أعتق رقبة — *free a slave*  
  → No type, condition, or description is specified.

** Muqayyad (Restricted)
Definition:  
"A word that is qualified, conditioned, or limited, indicating a reality with restriction."

Example:  
- أعتق رقبة مؤمنة — *free a believing slave*

** When both appear
Scholars determine:
- Does the Muqayyad restrict the Mutlaq?
- Or are they independent because the contexts differ?

This reconciliation preserves precision and consistency in fiqh.

* Restricting the Mutlaq (حمل المطلق على المقيد)
This explains **when** the Muqayyad restricts the Mutlaq and when it **does not**.

Scholars agree:
- Sometimes it applies.
- Sometimes it is invalid.
- Depends on the hukm (ruling) and sabab (reason).

** Four Scenarios

*** Case 1 — Same Hukm, Same Sabab → Mutlaq becomes restricted
If both texts share:
- the same ruling,
- the same cause,

→ The restricted (muqayyad) qualifies the unrestricted (mutlaq).

Example:  
Prohibition of *blood*.

Mutlaq:  
{حُرِّمَت عليكم … والدم} (5:3)

Muqayyad:  
{أو دماً مسفوحاً} — *spilled/flowing blood* (6:145)

Conclusion:  
Only *flowing blood* is prohibited.

*** Case 2 — Different Hukm, Different Sabab → Mutlaq remains unrestricted
If:
- the rulings differ,
- the reasons differ,

→ They cannot affect one another.

Example:
1. Cutting the hand of the thief — different hukm/sabab  
2. Washing hands for wudu — different hukm/sabab

Therefore:  
No cross-restriction.

*** Case 3 — Different Hukm, Same Sabab → Mutlaq remains unrestricted
If:
- rulings differ,
- reason is the same,

→ Mutlaq generally remains unrestricted.

Example:
1. Wudu: wash hands to elbows (restricted)  
2. Tayammum: wipe hands (unrestricted)

Reason in both: *purification*  
But rulings differ → no restriction.

*** Case 4 — Same Hukm, Different Sabab → Disagreement; majority restrict
If:
- rulings are the same,
- reasons differ,

→ Majority: the Muqayyad restricts the Mutlaq.

Example:
1. Zihār expiation — free *a slave* (mutlaq)
2. Killing expiation — free *a believing slave* (muqayyad)

Majority:  
The unrestricted becomes restricted unless evidence shows independence.

* Exercises (From the Slides)

** Case 1
Text 1: List of prohibited marriage relations (Qur’an).  
Mutlaq regarding **breastfeeding relationships**.

Text 2: Aisha’s report — prohibition occurs after **five known sucklings**.

→ The Mutlaq becomes restricted (same hukm, same sabab).

** Case 2
Text 1: “The Prophet cursed the women who visit graves.”  
Text 2: “The Prophet cursed the women who *frequently* visit graves.”

→ Mutlaq becomes restricted to *frequent* visits.

** Case 3
Text 1: Lower garment below ankles “is in the Fire.”  
Text 2: Trailing garment out of *arrogance* — Allah will not look at him.

→ Reason differs → majority: mutlaq becomes restricted by arrogance.  
(Ibn Taymiyyah, Nawawi, many later scholars)

** Case 4
Text 1: “No marriage except with a guardian.”  
Text 2: “No marriage except with a responsible guardian.”

→ Mutlaq is restricted by the description “responsible”.

* Closing
May Allah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad ﷺ, his companions, and those who follow his way. Ameen.
