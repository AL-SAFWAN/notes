* What does Usul al-Fiqh entail?
*Definition* of /Usul al-Fiqh/:

- A general knowledge of:
  - the *evidences* of fiqh,
    - 
  - the *manner* of deriving rulings from them,
  - and the *standing* (qualities) of the person who is able to derive rulings.

Illustrated as three pillars:

1. *Evidences of Fiqh* (‫األدلة‬)
2. *The manner of deriving rulings* – indications of words  
   (/dalālāt al-alfāẓ/ – ‫دالالت األلفاظ‬)
3. *The one able to derive rulings* – the mujtahid  
   (/al-mujtahid/ – ‫املجتهد‬)

* Section 1 – al-Adillah (‫األدلة‬) – The Evidences

** Definition of dalīl (‫دليل‬)

- /Adillah/ (‫األدلة‬) is the plural of /dalīl/.
- *Linguistically*:  
  - “That which guides or leads to something” – the guide and one who shows the way.
- *Technically (in uṣūl)*:  
  - «ما يمكن التوصل بصحيح النظر فيه إلى مطلوب خبري»
  - “That through correct analysis of which one can arrive at a sought-after informative conclusion (about belief or a matter of information).”
- shows the correct evidence
  - and then how to take the correct ruling from it 
In short:  
A dalīl is any shar‘ī proof which, when reflected upon properly, leads to a sound conclusion.

** Categories of evidences (al-Adillah)

Overall structure:

- *Evidences* (‫األدلة‬)
 
  - *Evidences agreed upon* (‫أدلة متفق عليها‬)
    - this is the foudnation of islam
    1. The Qur’an (‫القرآن‬)
    2. The Sunnah (‫السنَّة‬)
    3. Consensus – /ijmā‘/ (‫اإلجماع‬)
    4. Analogy – /qiyās/ (‫القياس‬)

  - *Disputed evidences* (‫أدلة مختلف عليها‬)
    1. Statements of the Companions (‫قول الصحابي‬)
       - can have a contradiction between shahabah
    2. Juristic preference – /al-istiḥsān/ (‫االستحسان‬)
    3. Unrestricted public interest – /al-maṣlaḥah al-mursalah/ (‫املصلحة املرسلة‬)
    4. The law of previous nations (‫شرع من قبلنا‬)

** Statement of Imām al-Shāfi‘ī

قال الشافعي رحمه هللا:
«وجهة العلم: في الكتاب، أو السنَّة، أو اإلجماع، أو القياس»

- “The foundation (direction) of knowledge is:  
  from the Book (Qur’an), or the Sunnah, or consensus (ijmā‘), or analogy (qiyās).”

This summarises the *primary* uṣūlī evidences agreed upon by the scholars.

* Section 2 – al-Kitāb (‫الكتاب‬) – The Qur’an

** Evidence (1) – The Book of Allah

   - The types of *aḥkām* (rulings) in the Qur’an

3. *Third topic*:

(This lesson focuses on the first part: definition and preservation.)

** Defining the Qur’an

Arabic definition:

هو كالم هللا تعالى، املنزل على سيدنا محمد - صلى هللا عليه وسلم - باللفظ العر يب، املنقول إلينا بالتواتر، املكتوب بالمصاحف، املتعبد بتالوته، املبدوء بسورة الفاتحة، املختوم بسورة الناس.


Breakdown:
- It is the *speech of Allah*, Most High.
  - directly from Allah
    - this could mean hadith qusi as well 
- Revealed to *our Prophet Muḥammad* ﷺ.
- Revealed *in the Arabic wording*.
  - everythig else is the tranlsation of the quran
- Transmitted to us by *mass, recurrent narration* (/tawātur/).
  - hundrends of shahabah
    - impossibe to something else
- *Recorded* in the written copies (/maṣāḥif/).S
- *Reciting it* is an act of worship.
  - not the same thing for hadith qursi
    - you won't be reward like the quran
- It *begins* with Sūrat al-Fātiḥah.
- It *ends* with Sūrat al-Nās.

** The compilation of the Qur’an
- nothing has been changed at all

  there is two types of presevation
Main aims:
1. *Preserving the Qur’an from corruption*
   - Protection from alteration, addition, or loss.
     - from the heaven
       - before it was revelaed to the prophet (ﷺ)
         - the pen writed down the quran in lawhu mathoz
           - only allowing the most pureing greatest angles can come close to it
             - the kahba of the first heaven, the quran is brought down and reaveald it to the angelsin 
     - and the earth
       - form jibreal to the Prophet (ﷺ)
         - all sytaan and jin was not able to come close to the qur'an
           - Allah chose the grestest of angles tot he grestest of human
             - Allah prevent the Prophet (ﷺ) to make any mistake when reciting
               - The prophet tried to memrorise it, but Allah has assured the prophet we will be the one that will reveal it so don't worry about memorise it
                 - you won't be able to forget it
                   - this is a veriul of the prphet (ﷺ)
                     - During Ramadan Jibreal with revise with the Prophet (ﷺ) 
2. *Preserving the Qur’an through writing and memorisation*
   - Written in physical form.
     - write on anything, leaves and rock
       and they will recite what they write
       - and it will be corrected
     - know as the book
       - every ayah was writen down
         - don't write anything from me except the sunnah
           - then after they wrote down the sunnah when they could differeciate
   - Preserved in the hearts of the believers (ḥuffāẓ).
     - he would correct them if they made mistakes
       - he (ﷺ) would call for shahaba to recited, especically when revilation came
         - e.g zayb ibn zabit
           - spacial person
             - he would write it down straight away
               - the scribe who wrote the wahyy
                 - and he would recite it back
                   - he wrote compiled it when abu bakr asked him to 
                   - he would arrage the surah when the prophet (ﷺ) ask
                   - and was practice by many shahbah eg ali ra, uthman, muawiyaa
     - preserved by acting according it
       - easy to meemoriese
     - the book was not compiles during the life of the prophet (ﷺ)
       - Allah reavel the quran is 7 differnt ahruf (as a rusksa)
         - to make it easier for the ummah
           - ahruf is mean

               - the qurashi dialect was reveal, the usul
                 - it mean there are different dialect that Allah has revealed

             - different mode
               - mode of laws of prohibition
             - we don't know what it means

               
*** Aspects of preservation
usool al-quran

The slides highlight several stages:

1. *Preserving the Qur’an in the heavens*
   - First preserved in *al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ* (the Preserved Tablet).
2. *Preserving the Qur’an on its way to the world*
   - Revelation via Jibrīl (ʿalayhi s-salām).
3. *Preserving the Qur’an during the life of Muḥammad ﷺ*
   - Recited, taught, and reviewed with the Companions.
4. *Preservation through writing & memorisation*
   - Written by the Companions (kuttāb al-waḥy).
   - Memorised by large numbers of ḥuffāẓ in every generation.

(Details of the historical compilation in the periods of Abū Bakr and ʿUthmān, etc., are to be filled in from further study or class notes.)

* The importance of studying Usul al-Fiqh

Imām al-Qarāfī said:

> “He who does not study uṣūl al-fiqh is prohibited from issuing fatwas,  
> for he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts,  
> nor how to restrict and specify general directives.”

This shows that:
- without uṣūl, one cannot:
  - correctly *understand* evidences,
  - *differentiate* between similar concepts,
  - or *limit and specify* general texts.
- therefore, studying uṣūl is *essential* for anyone involved in iftā’ or advanced study of fiqh.

* Closing

And may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and the seal of the Prophets, Muḥammad, his Companions, and all those who follow his way. *Āmīn.*
