#+title: Fasid
* al-Fasid – The Corrupted/Invalid
** Linguistic Definition:
fasid comes from the Arabic root word ‫د‬ ‫س‬ ‫ف‬ (fasada), which means "to corrupt," "to spoil,"
or "to decay."

** •Technical Definition:
An act or contract performed incorrectly, not meeting the requirements legislated by the lawgiver, thus preventing the perpetrator to acquire the intended benefit of the act.

** •Explanation:
Fasid simply denotes the invalidity of actions or contracts in Islamic law
- won't be able to acquire the indented benfit
  e.g fasid marriages, the befinit of validity is invalid, so it's not accepted by Allah as there was no mahram.
** Examples•

Invalid Fasting: Deliberate eating or drinking during Ramadan without a valid reason invalidates the fast.

•Improper Prayer (Salah): If a prayer is performed without the necessary conditions, such as purity, it is
considered fasid.

•Transactions: Selling an ambiguous item.

•Marriage Without Wali: A marriage conducted without the knowledge or consent of the wali.

** fasid = batil

While fasid (invalid) and batil (false) are generally synonymous, they differ distinctly in two specific scenario:

In Ihram:

        Fasid applies to violations by a person in Ihram,
        - for example have a marital relations
          - must continue to do hajj and return to do it again
        
        On the other hand batil (false) described more severs infractions, such as renouncing Islam while in Ihram
        - his hajj is violated 

In Marriage:
        Fasid refers to conditions within a marriage that scholars have debated over, such as the validity of a marriage without a valid (guardian).
        - marriage is still valid according to imaan abu hanifa
          
        batil, however, refers to conditions unanimously recognised as invalid, such as the marriage of a widow or a divorced woman during her waiting period, which is universally accepted as invalid

* book
linguistically
something that has been corrupted or is at a loss.
Technically
action or contract that fail to produce their intended legal effect.
- are those that do not fulfil the obligation required, resulting in an unmet religious demand


All corrupt acts of worship, contracts and related condition are considered [[id:3e653a3f-bd40-4551-b7fc-28c32b7ec903][haram]] (forbidden); this is viewed as overstepping Allah's limits and mocking His verse, especially since the prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) forbade stipulating conditions that are not sanctioned by the Book of Allah.

Example
Fasid (invalid) action of worship
- such as praying before the appointed time.
  
Fasid (invalid) contracts
- to sell something unspecified or unknown.

(These distinctions highlight the specific legal consequence and religious implications associated with each term, reflecting the depth and complexity of Islamic jurisprudential terminology)
