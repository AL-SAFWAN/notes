Usul is the plural of the word 'asl', and it means whatever can have something else built upon it ; from that we have the asl foundation of a wall which is in essence its base; likewise the foundation of a tree which has many branches sprouting from it.

As Allah (ﷻ) the most High says:

 have you not considered how Allah presents an example, making a good wrld like a good tree. Whose root is firmly fixed and it's branches high in the sky? 14:24
