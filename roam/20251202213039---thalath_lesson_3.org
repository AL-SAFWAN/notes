                - shirk is a great oppression
                  oppresion is to put something other than it please
                  so you have put worhsip other than it's place
- Ibrahim new that shirk is something that he might fall into hence he had the fear in the hear
  - how did shirk enter into this earth
    - hadith qudsi - Allah created everyone upon tahweed and stay away from shirk with intent and the saytaan came to them and took them away from their relgion and prohibited them what i have made haram and commit shirk that Allah has given no right
    - every child is born upon fitrah  
    - the people was on tawheed for 10 generation/centeries
    - then shytaan came and plot
      - wishpering about the pious people
        - why don't you hand these people
          - it will remind you how great he was and it iwll engorage you more about Allah
            - they start to hand these people up and it reminded them of allah
              - then after many generation the people said look at these statuses surely our fathers worship them
                - shytaan plans longers term
                  - he told them to do something that which will bring them colser to allah
                    - after generation this knowledge will be lost
                      - Allah sent the first messenger Noah
                        - they say he called upon tawheed for 950years
                          - less than 20 people accept the messgage 
                        - he was the first messenger
                          - then ibrahm
- then from the progency of ibrahm
  - the arab was upon the relgion of tawheed
    - untill a man umar ibn amir ibn luhay ibn qasee
      - he was a nobel mand and had a high station
        - he sent to ash sham and saw the shirk that was being commited there and was amazed by it
          - on the short he saw the idols, some of the scholars says these idols are the idols of nuh
        - he gather these idos and bought them to makkah
          - the propeht (ﷺ) saw him draging his intestine in the fire  
          - he (ﷺ) distory 360 idol  
          - prophet came gerneratio after generatio n
            - and he was the only one that was able to distory them all
            - indeed the only accept religion is islam
            - shirk is to do other than Allah with Allah
              - why this def
                - there are two types of dua
                  - dua ul masalah - the dua of asking
                    - eg. oh allah grant me health
                      - this is also aprt of dua ul ibadah
                  - dua ul ibadah - the dua of worship
                    - every single acts of worhsip
                      - when he is prayering it as if he saying oh Allah accept this salah for me
            - this is not the general defntion given early
              - shirk vs kuft
                - kufr is disbelift
                - shirk is polythism
                - the principle is
                  - every shrik is kufr
                  - not every kufr is shirk
                  - major disblieft and major kufr takes you out of the fold of islam   
                  - there are certain things that take you out of islam that take you out of the fold of islam
                    - e.g insult the Prophet (ﷺ)  
                  - shirk ul asgar
                    - the lesser kuft and shirt
                      - they are major sin but do not expect someone out of Islam 
                      - there is no clear def for lesser shirk  
                      - we understand it throught examples
                        - to assosiate and like to someonething to Allah but not in the compelte manner
                          - e.g. making a oath other than Allah
                            - unless they want to make the oath to that thing is glorify them then is it major shirk 
                            - to touch a tree for a blessign
                            - to hand talisman is shirk
                              - if they believe that the thing itself is the thing that give the blessing then this is major shirk
                            - denying the blessing of Allah
                            - fighting the Muslim is kufr
                              - the word kuft was here is used harshlly not intending the word itself, but so it acts as a deterrent
                            - the one who ties the kinship will not enter jannah
                              - this doesn not mean the person is a kafir 
                          - what the prophet (ﷺ) fear for the companion
                            
- so these are of the above are the introduction for the books, compiled from the students from all the dars


** so If it is said to you: *How did you come to know of your Lord?*

- we knoe allah by his signs and creation
  - the day the night ect 
  - why difference the sings and cration
    when the creation is the signs as well
  - they are clearer sign
    - e.g the day will come and it will go some day is it is darker
    - these are something that we can wtiness and see them 
    - do not bow down the sun and moon, but th eone who created all of them
      - the creatoer of heaven and earth 
      - these thing that some and go
        - it shows something has created them
          - something that can be witnessed
 
 the lord is the one who is to be worshiped
 - as he has the attributes to that which should be worshiped
