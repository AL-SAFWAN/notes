the pillars of islam is 5

The shadaha has two pillars
1. the first part of the shahdah (2 pillars itself)
   1. you /negate/ worship except for Allah
   2. you *affirm* the complete worship only for Allah
   .eg the statement of ibrahim
   - there are /7 condtion/ (shurut) to this
     - the things that they need to establish before the shadah
     - wahd ibn munadir
       - if the key have teeth the door will open, if not then it will not open
     - hasan al basri
       - who ever fufill the right of shahad and it's obligation will enter the doors paridise
     condition
     1. ilm
        - knowledge of the shahadah
          - they testify with truth and know
            - the nullifier for this condtion is jahl ignorance
     2. certainty
        - indeed the believer believe in Allah and the messenger (ﷺ)  with no doubt
          - nullifier is doubt shakh
     3. Truthful
        Allah know those who are truthful and those who are lying
        - you accet it inwardly and outwardly
          - the nillfier is hipocracy nifaq
     4. sincerity
        you have not been comand but to make your entire relgion for the sake of Allah
        - the nullifier fo this is shirk 
     5. muhabah
        to love
        for mankind is those who have take reival and lov ethem and for those who believ loves Allah more
        - love the relgion and the law and the legislation
          - and do not hate a single thing from it
            - the kafir hate Allah reveals
              - we might find it difficult but we love it
                e.g [[id:c6f923c6-6113-4201-8292-480714365ba1][Jihad is a hard but beloved ruling (loving Allah’s commands despite hardship)]]
                - the nullifier is hatred
     6. kubol
        - to accept everything, Allah, the prophet (ﷺ), the rulings
        - and nullifier is to reject it
     7. 'inkiyad
        - to act upon that which the shadaha necceitages
          to worship allah aloen and note commite shirk
          - nullfier is itrab
            to turn away
            - who is more oppersive as the one who is reminded about Allah but he turns away
2. to believe in the prophet (ﷺ) and that he is the final messenger
   - a messenger has come from yourself, to address all of mankind
     - to obey him in that which he has commanded
       - we don't say he said other than the truth
         - the one who only say the truth hadith
           - the onely one we accept truth from
             - to stay away from that which he has prohibted us
               - not to worship allah except that which he revealed
                 - he only showed that which Allah has ordained
                   - to follow the correct way
                     - teh statement of the believers are
                       - is we hear and we obey
                         - we don't find any difficulty in our heart
                           - other metniton scholars
                             - we love him more than anyone else
                               - we put him before anyone else
                                 - we believe everything that he said
                                   - and we profess it
                                     - you have certainty with that which he had came with
                                       - we implement that which he a tought us
                                         - why are this two part consider two pilars

Why are these two pillars apart of the shadahs
  - becasue we can not worship Allah except what the prohet (ﷺ) has taught us
    - if it wasn't for Allah then the prophet (ﷺ) we won't know how to worship Allah
      - hence these are considers as 1 pillars of Islam
        - the same way which the quran is preserved the way the sunnah has been preserved  
    - who ever rejects the sunnah has not fulfiled this condtion
      - his path is the only path
        - hadith who ever does a action that doesn't not follow it then it will be reject
- can also be fond in hadith jireal
  - and some of the other hadith           


how does a person enter into the fold of islam
- there are two types which a person enters into
  1. the eyes of the people (3 ways he enters)
     1. to /testify/ in front of people
     2. any one of this 2 /parents/ is a muslim
     3. he does an /exclusive action/ that only the Muslim do
     if he does any of these it mean that the ruling of Islam is established on him
     - jew said the testomny in faith then said i was joking and was punished of apostay during the time of iman ahmed
     - hadith a battle a person was fleeing and syaing the shadah, usama ibn zayd, he killed him and the prophet (ﷺ) did you kill him after he said the shahadah, then he (ﷺ) repeast did you cut his chest to see what he believed
       - usama has said i wish i had not become muslim after this
         - so if you have said shahadah it has made you a muslim, until we have certainty he has left Islam    
  2. in the sight of Allah
     - only Allah know
       - e.g the hyprocrite of the muslim
         - the faith was only apparent by the people
           - but amongst themselve it was apparent

-----

  - then he is a disbeliever
they one who doesn't preform these pillars

  - the sahabah agreed that it take them out of the fold of islam
    - the differenct when and how many of salah
      - umar said if it was once out of intentilly
        - he has leaved the fold of islam
        - this is the view of number of shabah
      - some said 2
        - abdulah ibn masood
          - he might left the first to combine 
      - some said more than this

  - what cause you to etner the fire
    - we was from theose who did not pray
- ahmed ibn habel
  - ibless didn't want to do a single sajood and left the fold of islam
    - what about the people that leave more than this 
- mising the zakat, fast and hajj
  - if you have a weak foundation it will weaken it to make you commit a act of disbelieft
    - it is a major sin
      - abu bakr fought those who refused to give zakat
        - to fight and not give it, this is disbelieft
          - like wise fasting and hajj
           umar used to say to those who can afford to go to had
            - it doesn't bother me if they die a jew or a christain
