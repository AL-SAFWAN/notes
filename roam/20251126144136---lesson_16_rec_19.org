* Recap – The categories of evidences (al-Adillah الأدلّة)
- *Evidences agreed upon* (أدلة متفق عليها):
  1. Qur’an (القرآن)
  2. Sunnah (السنة)
  3. Ijmā‘ (الإجماع)
  4. Qiyās (القياس)

- *Disputed evidences* (أدلة مختلف عليها):
  1. Statements of the Companions (قول الصحابي)
  2. al-Istiḥsān (الاستحسان)
  3. al-Maṣlaḥah al-Mursalah (المصلحة المرسلة)
  4. Shar‘ man qablana – the law of previous nations (شرع من قبلنا)

- Statement of Imām al-Shāfi‘ī:
  - «وَجْهَةُ العِلْمِ: في الكتاب، أو السنّة، أو الإجماع، أو القياس»
  - “The foundation of knowledge is: a report from the Book (the Qur’an), or the Sunnah, or consensus (ijmāʿ), or analogy (qiyās).”

* An-Naskh – Abrogation
** Definition
- Linguistic root: النَّسخ carries meanings such as:
  - removal / lifting,
  - transfer or copying.
- Technical definition in uṣūl:
  - *“The removal (or lifting) of a previously established legal ruling by a later revelation.”*
  - i.e. a shar‘ī ruling that was once in force is superseded by another shar‘ī text that comes after it.

** Key point
- Naskh is *not* contradiction.
  - It reflects a *change in legislation* based on divine wisdom.
  - Each ruling was correct and binding *in its time*; the later ruling simply replaces the earlier one.

* Examples of An-Naskh
1. **Explicit Qur’anic mention of abrogation**
   - Allah says (meaning):
     - “Whatever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring forth one better than it or similar to it…”  
       (Sūrat al-Baqarah 2:106)

2. **Abrogation of previous divine laws**
   - The Sharī‘ah of Muḥammad ﷺ abrogates earlier heavenly laws where they differ from it.
   - For example, certain dietary and Sabbath laws given to Banū Isrā’īl are no longer binding on this Ummah.

3. **Abrogation of the Qiblah**
   - Initially, the Muslims faced *Bayt al-Maqdis* (Jerusalem) in prayer.
   - Later, Allah commanded them to face *al-Masjid al-Ḥarām* in Makkah:
     - “So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Ḥarām; and wherever you are, turn your faces toward it…”  
       (Sūrat al-Baqarah 2:144)

4. **Abrogation of the prohibition of visiting graves**
   - At first, the Prophet ﷺ forbade visiting graves.
   - Later he said:
     - “I had prohibited you from visiting graves — now visit them, for they remind you of the Hereafter.”
   - The earlier prohibition was abrogated; visiting graves is now recommended as a reminder of death and the Hereafter.

* Where abrogation does *not* occur
Naskh applies to *legislative rulings* (aḥkām fiqhiyyah), not to every type of text.

1. **Matters of ʿAqīdah (belief)**
   - Beliefs such as:
     - tawḥīd and the Oneness of Allah,
     - belief in the Hereafter,
     - angels, books, messengers, qadar.
   - These are eternal truths and are *not* subject to abrogation.

2. **Reports and stories of the past**
   - Historical reports: stories of previous nations, Prophets, Banū Isrā’īl, Fir‘awn, Iblīs, etc.
   - These are informational (khabar), not commands, so abrogation does not apply.

3. **Universal moral values**
   - Core ethical values like:
     - justice, honesty, compassion, trustworthiness.
   - These are rooted in the fiṭrah and remain constant.

4. **Actions legislated for eternity**
   - Certain rulings remain until the Day of Judgement, e.g.:
     - jihād as a means of defending the faith,
     - the permanent prohibition of marrying the wives of the Prophet ﷺ after him.

* Pillars of abrogation (arkān an-naskh)
For naskh to exist, three elements are considered:

1. *An-Nāsikh* – the abrogating text or ruling.
2. *al-Mansūkh* – the abrogated text or ruling.
3. *al-Mansūkh ʿanhu* – the subject(s) affected by that ruling (those for whom it applied).

** 1. An-Nāsikh – The abrogating text
- Definition:
  - The *later* law or text that supersedes a previous ruling.
- Role:
  - Represents the *final, current* ruling to be followed.
- Conditions:
  - Must be *revealed after* the mansūkh.
  - Clearly *replaces* or modifies the earlier ruling.
  - Itself must be a valid shar‘ī proof (Qur’an or Sunnah) and clear in indication.
  - Its “strength” (in terms of source and indication) must be sufficient to override the earlier ruling.
- Example:
  - The command to face the Kaʿbah in Makkah abrogated the earlier command to face *Bayt al-Maqdis*.

** 2. al-Mansūkh – The abrogated text
- Definition:
  - The earlier ruling that has been *lifted* by a later text.
- Role:
  - Was binding before the nāsikh appeared;
  - after abrogation it is *no longer acted upon*.
- Conditions:
  - Applied *before* the nāsikh was revealed.
  - After the nāsikh, it is no longer valid to implement it as law.
  - The fact it is abrogated does *not* mean it was false; rather, the ruling has fulfilled its wisdom and time.
- Example:
  - Early concessions and forms of fasting that were modified by later verses in Sūrat al-Baqarah (2:183–185).

** 3. al-Mansūkh ʿanhu – The subject affected
- Definition:
  - The person(s) or group for whom the abrogated ruling previously applied.
- Role:
  - They move from being bound by the earlier ruling to being bound by the new one.
- Example:
  - Early in Islam, Muslims were prohibited from visiting graves; they were the *mansūkh ʿanhu* for that ruling.
  - After the new command permitting grave visitation, they are no longer sinful for doing so.

* Categories of abrogation (with respect to the text)
1. **Ruling abrogated, wording remains**
   - The verse remains in the muṣḥaf and is recited.
   - However, the legal ruling it once carried is no longer in force.

2. **Wording abrogated, ruling remains**
   - The specific verse is no longer recited as Qur’an,
   - but its *legal ruling* continues to be implemented via other evidences.

3. **Both wording and ruling abrogated**
   - The verse is no longer recited,
   - and the legal ruling is no longer in force.

* Types of abrogation – with or without replacement
When Allah abrogates a ruling, it may or may not be replaced by another ruling.

** 1. Abrogation *with replacement*
a) *Equal replacement*  
   - Example: change of the qiblah from Jerusalem to Makkah.
   - The act (facing a direction in prayer) remains, but the object changes.

b) *Lighter replacement*  
   - Some rulings are replaced with something *easier*, e.g.:
     - adjustments to the rules of fasting,
     - changes in the rules of fighting at different stages of the daʿwah.

c) *Stricter replacement*  
   - Some rulings are replaced with something *more stringent*, e.g.:
     - the gradual prohibition of alcohol:
       - from discouragement,
       - to prohibition near prayer,
       - to complete and final prohibition.

** 2. Abrogation *without replacement*
- A ruling is lifted and *no new ruling* comes in its place.
- Example:
  - The obligation to give charity before privately consulting the Prophet ﷺ:
    - Initially required,
    - then removed with no comparable replacement ruling.

* Ways to recognise abrogation
1. **Explicit text**
   - A text clearly states that a *previous ruling has been abrogated*.  
   - Example: The hadith where the Prophet ﷺ says:
     - “I had prohibited you from visiting graves – now visit them...”
   - This directly announces abrogation.

2. **Later text (chronology)**
   - Knowing that one text came *later* than another,
   - and the two rulings cannot be reconciled,
   - shows that the later one abrogates the earlier.

3. **Consensus of the Companions**
   - The Companions may agree that a certain ruling has been abrogated by another,
   - even if no explicit wording of abrogation occurs in the text itself.

4. **Abandonment by the Companions**
   - At times, the Companions stop acting on a hadith or ruling,
   - without any explicit statement of naskh.
   - Their *consistent abandonment* while acting on another text can indicate that the first has been superseded.

* Exercise
- From the examples mentioned:
  - identify which pillar(s) of naskh are visible in each case,
  - determine whether the abrogation is with or without replacement,
  - and reflect on how we know *which* text came later.

* Closing
- Imām al-Qarāfī said:
  - “He who does not study uṣūl al-fiqh is prohibited from issuing fatwas,
    for he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts,
    nor how to restrict and specify general directives.”

May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and the seal of the Prophets, Muḥammad,
his Companions and all those who follow his way. *Āmīn.*
