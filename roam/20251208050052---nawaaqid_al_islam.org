#+TITLE: The Invalidators of Islam (Nawaaqid al‑Islam)
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhaab (d. 1206 AH)
Bismillah - In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.


* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** Know that the nullifiers of Islam are ten
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a349740d-fe15-40ee-b09f-8058e651ec50
:END:
- these are the main nullifiers of his time that the author listed
  - they would often place them at the end of the chapters of fiqh
    - the nullifiers vary in number from scholar to scholar
      - but we find these in our time as well, and others like evolution and feminism

** The danger of the nullifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9ca2a36a-70d1-45e1-8fe8-b46788e97514
:END:
- these are things that destroy a person’s Islām and take them out of the fold of Islām
  - their actions will be nullified in this world and the Hereafter
    - ḥadīth: “Whoever changes his religion, then kill him.”
  - we learn about them so we can stay away from them

** Īmān – definition and nature
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       be33e4e5-9288-4ae0-9284-ec8afd69c041
:END:
*** Components of īmān
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       547904f2-6de7-4920-b1f6-24d746d69674
:END:
- īmān is:
  - belief
  - statement
  - action
- actions are a part of īmān
  - only Imām Abū Ḥanīfah said they are not *part* of īmān, but he still affirmed the actions
    - he said īmān is belief, and the actions are from the Sharī‘ah
- īmān:
  - increases with obedience
  - decreases with disobedience

*** The heart and the limbs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       69b52d57-c66f-4f24-b5f0-35801615b314
:END:
- the heart is the reflection of the actions, and the actions are a reflection of the heart
  - e.g. the ḥadīth about the “piece of flesh”:
    - [[id:11b2fdf3-682d-48b9-b5ef-4cf4665800b0][There is a piece of flesh in the body; if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good, but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt, and that is the heart.]]
  - you will be accountable for your statements, beliefs and actions

*** Types of people with respect to heart and actions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e92847e9-1aa7-47c1-8e49-82172ab159c1
:END:
- good heart and good action → Muslim
- good heart and bad action → does not exist
  - if your heart is upright then we will see it in your actions
- bad heart and good action → munāfiq (hypocrite)
- bad heart and bad action → kāfir (disbeliever)

- hence it is important to come to Allah with a pure heart

** The opposite of īmān: kufr
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6d284f24-f4ff-4a31-a728-780f5a77a6ff
:END:
*** What is kufr?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       45a5fb7d-f17d-4074-afa3-c7e666cf81f5
:END:
- we enter into īmān and leave kufr
- the meaning of kufr is the absence of īmān
  - also in:
    - statements and actions of the heart
    - and statements and actions of the limbs

- e.g. in the rulings of this world:
  - a person could be judged as a Muslim outwardly
    - but in their heart is disbelief and he is a munāfiq
      - his ruling in the Hereafter is that of a kāfir
  - or there could be a person who is judged as a disbeliever in this world
    - but may believe inwardly and be tested in the Hereafter

*** No joking with Islām
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1917c333-af21-4394-b2c5-6fb9a3de402d
:END:
- there is no such thing as joking about Islām
  - (e.g. the Jew at the time of Imām Aḥmad who said the testimony then said “I was joking” and was punished for apostasy)
- īmān prevents this
- certain actions will take the person out of Islām, such as:
  - imitating the kuffār in matters of pure disbelief
  - killing a prophet
  - (exceptions:)
    - if you are deceiving them in war
    - or using a resemblance *for a ḥājah* (valid need) without intending their religion
  - shirk (associating partners with Allah)
  - turning away from the religion completely
  - pride and arrogance against the truth
  - mocking and joking about Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ)
  - making something ḥarām ḥalāl or ḥalāl ḥarām (changing the Sharī‘ah)
  - nifāq (hypocrisy in belief)

*** Takfīr based on Sharī‘ah, not desire
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       27bff40d-0238-427b-b322-1cb2eb9ebac2
:END:
        
**** Principle from al-Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c31bb60c-fb64-409f-927d-99b1d07cd86b
:END:
- al-Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ: a person cannot be judged to be a disbeliever just by our minds,
  - rather only by way of the Sharī‘ah
- pronouncing disbelief (takfīr) on someone is the right of Allah

- if someone calls you a kāfir, you cannot simply call him a kāfir back
  - incident of Ibn Taymiyyah and al-Bakrī:
    - al-Bakrī made takfīr of Ibn Taymiyyah because he did not make du‘ā’ *to* the Prophet (ﷺ)
    - people asked Ibn Taymiyyah to make takfīr of al-Bakrī in return
      - he said: takfīr is the right of Allah, so how can I make takfīr of him just because he made it of me?

**** Statement of Ibn Ḥazm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       af2b9179-3f2a-4bc6-bb55-4c9e6f504006
:END:
- Ibn Ḥazm:
  - disbelief is a description of a person’s religion
    - after the evidence has been established and the truth has reached him
      - and he still denies it, then he has disbelief

** Types of takfīr
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       11dd8a89-d1ef-467f-9bef-43fbfef73936
:END:
*** General takfīr (takfīr al-muṭlaq)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6a074d7b-a48b-4fb0-bb91-0692fe3720d2
:END:
- /takfīr al-muṭlaq/ – general takfīr:
  - “whoever does such-and-such is a disbeliever”
- this does *not* necessitate specific takfīr of a named individual
  - making general takfīr does not automatically make a specific person a kāfir

- example:
  - the Jahmiyyah: many scholars said their *beliefs* are kufr
    - they brought a specific person from the Jahmiyyah to Imām Aḥmad
      - he did not declare that individual a kāfir
      - it requires investigation

- example from Ibn Taymiyyah:
  - he said: if *I* were to say the same things as the Jahmiyyah, I would be a kāfir,
    - because I know that your statement is disbelief
    - but you are saying it because you are /jāhil/ (ignorant)
      - you will not be a disbeliever until I establish the evidence upon you
        - and then, if you still continue in these actions, then you will be a kāfir

- The fitnah of our time:
  - some groups make takfīr of another group
    - then they ask a third group: “Is that group a kāfir?”
      - if they say “no”, they make takfīr of the third group as well
        - this causes a domino effect
          - until they start fighting the Muslims

*** Specific takfīr (takfīr al-muʿayyan)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cb4c89ca-d7ff-49ea-bd89-d138d320b159
:END:
- /takfīr al-muʿayyan/ – specific takfīr:
  - declaring: “so-and-so person is a disbeliever”

** Conditions for specific takfīr (of one who attributes to Islām)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7672ae0b-d5f6-4341-8a7a-18e96fcab1e7
:END:

- there are 6 conditions of making takfīr of a specific individual
  - this is for a *Muslim* (or one who attributes himself to Islām),
    - not for Jews or Christians

*** Condition 1: The action is clear disbelief
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1cf60516-c0fa-48ac-b81f-93768b52b736
:END:
- there is clear evidence that the /action/ in discussion is clear disbelief
  - if all the scholars agree, we can say the action is kufr
  - it must be an evidence that cannot be refuted

- examples:
  - the Qādiyānī group:
    - every group of Ahl al-Sunnah agrees they are kuffār,
      since they believe a prophet came after the Prophet (ﷺ)
  - mocking an obvious symbol of the religion, like mocking the miswāk, in a way that mocks the Sharī‘ah itself

*** Condition 2: Certainty about the person’s action
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f5726f78-d118-4697-98e7-ffcd01c0bb36
:END:
- the /person/ in discussion is /certainly/ the doer of that /action/
  - if there is doubt, this condition is not satisfied
  - just because someone tells us does not mean the person is a kāfir
    - the one who told you may be mistaken
  - you have to be certain for yourself

- qāʿidah:
  - “whoever enters Islām with certainty, it cannot be removed by doubt”

- after certainty:
  - i.e. after establishing the proof against them and they are still persistent in their disbelief,
    - then they are a kāfir

*** Condition 3: Establishing the evidence upon him
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0bf32404-3ed5-4ed8-ab9c-a96295d5b5f1
:END:
- establish the /evidence/ against that /person/
  - there is no sin upon a person who makes a mistake in ignorance

- in a Muslim land (classical fiqh discussion):
  - the person may be imprisoned for 3 days
    - his doubts are removed
    - the evidence is made clear to him
  - some scholars say:
    - if there are materials to remove his doubt and he has not sought them out of laziness,
      then the proof has been established against him
  - after that, if he persists, then the ḥadd of apostasy is applied by the authorities

- hence there is a *process* and you cannot just go and kill a person

*** Condition 4: The person is mukallaf
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ef29aa87-8e20-401e-81a9-b33017e903a4
:END:
- the /person/ is a /mukallaf/:
  - sane
  - has reached the age of responsibility
  - aware of what he is saying/doing

*** Condition 5: The one making takfīr is grounded in knowledge
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       542d7493-9523-4643-916b-54bdcb7218bb
:END:
- the one who is making /takfīr/ is well-grounded in knowledge
  - the greatest calamity of the ummah is that the ignorant make takfīr of the scholars
    - e.g. the Khawārij and the Rāfiḍah

*** Condition 6: Absence of preventers (mawāniʿ)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cacc0eb5-1dea-498f-add6-8fcdf9dacd4d
:END:
- there must be *no preventers* of takfīr present.
  - even if there is a great scholar says so and so is a kafir
    - they can be correct and incorrect
      - hence you don't hold his worlds like the qur'an  
        - you can go against the ijtihad of a scholar, it is not binding upon you
          - since there could have been a preventer and there ijtihad could have been wrong
**** what is not a preventer
***** Joking/mocking
    - if they joke then it mean that the min level of eman is not there, hence it's not a prevent of takfir    
***** Holding onto you're worldly posistion/status
***** Practising the pilars are not prevented of takfir
- e.g the people who joke about the Prophet (ﷺ) and did jihad with the prophet (ﷺ)
      
**** there are 4 main preventers

** Mistakes of takfīr

*** Qāʿidah
#+begin_quote
Whoever /does not/ make takfīr of a disbeliever is himself a disbeliever.
#+end_quote

*** Who this *does* refer to (included)
- Everyone who is *not* attributed to Islām:
  - e.g. if someone says that the Jews, Christians, Buddhists and others will go to Jannah
    - then they are a kāfir, because Allah has called them kuffār
      - so for you to call them believers is as if you are saying Allah is lying in the Qur’ān.
  - people like the Qādiyānī (Ahmadi) sect.

*** Who this *does not* refer to (excluded)
- Matters where the ‘ulamā’ differ:
  - e.g. the one who leaves the ṣalāh (is he a kāfir or a fāsiq?).
- Anyone who believes that the *conditions* of takfīr are *not* fulfilled on a specific person:
  - i.e. the person could have been ignorant.
  - takfīr on a matter that is not clear, or which could have more than one possible meaning.

**** Example: ambiguous statements
- e.g. someone says: “the people of beards are criminals”
  - it could mean the anbiyā’ who had beards (if taken literally),
  - or it could mean a specific group of criminals who happen to have beards.
- Hence, if a statement reasonably has more than one possible meaning, we do *not* rush to takfīr.

**** Takfīr based on what a statement *necessitates*
- Example:
  - some people say: “Allah has inner speech and then Jibrīl translated it,”
    - this would *seem* to necessitate that:
      - Jibrīl’s ‘translation’ created the Qur’ān — its letters and words in Arabic —
      - and hence the Qur’ān would be *created*.
    - the Salaf said: “whoever says the Qur’ān is created is a kāfir.”
  - But:
    - if a person says “the Qur’ān is the inner speech of Allah,”
      - we do *not* automatically know that he means “the Qur’ān is created.”
    - so it is a mistake to make takfīr based on what a person’s words *might* necessitate.
      - it is like forcing someone to say something they did not explicitly say.
      - if this is what the statement logically necessitates:
        - it proves that the person’s statement is *contradictory*,
        - we use his contradictory statements to refute his belief,
          - but not to make takfīr of him.

- The correct belief:
  - Allah speaks whenever He wills and His speech can be heard.
    - e.g. Allah spoke to Mūsā (عليه السلام).

*** Takfīr as ijtihād, not a core point of ʿaqīdah
- Takfīr is a *matter of ijtihād*, not a fundamental point of ʿaqīdah.
  - it is for the mujtahid and the fuqahā’ to deal with.
- Hence:
  - if someone does not align with a *particular* application of takfīr,
    - it is not the same as differing in a core matter of ʿaqīdah.
      - because if their ʿaqīdah itself was corrupt, they would not be “from us.”
- For a statement to contradict the ʿaqīdah:
  - it means the *belief* itself is corrupt,
  - not merely that someone’s *ijtihād* in takfīr is different.

*** Takfīr related to major sins

**** Major sins vs disbelief
- That which has *not* reached the boundary of disbelief:
  - you cannot make takfīr of someone *just* for a major sin.
**** Meaning of “major sin”
- A *major sin* includes:
  1. that which has a capital punishment in this world:
     - theft,
     - zinā,
  2. or its punishment is explicitly mentioned in the Hereafter:
     - consuming the wealth of the orphan,
  3. or whoever does this action is *cursed*:
     - e.g. those who do tattoos and those who pluck their eyebrows,
       - the meaning of “curse” is being pushed away from the mercy of Allah.
  4. or the anger of Allah is upon him:
     - e.g. killing a believer intentionally.
  5. or īmān has been negated for the person:
     - e.g. the one whose neighbour is not safe from his harm.
  6. or it is “this person is not from us,”
     - or the Prophet (ﷺ) said he is free from such a person,
       - e.g. the one who slaps the cheeks and wails (at a calamity).

- A major sin:
  - *requires* a specific expiation (tawbah, ḥadd, etc.).
- Minor sins:
  - can be expiated with good deeds.

**** Proximity of major sins to kufr
- The more severe the sin, the closer it is to the boundary of disbelief.

- Ḥadīth:
  - “The fornicator is not a believer *while* he is committing fornication…”
    - he drops from the level of *mu’min* to the basic level of *Muslim* while in that state.
    - he can rise back up to the level of *mu’min* by:
      - seeking repentance,
      - even seeking the prescribed punishment (ḥadd),
        - e.g. ḥadīth of Mā‘iz,
      - entering the Fire of Jahannam if he was not forgiven before:
        - he will *not* remain there forever if two conditions are met:
          1. he is from the people of tawḥīd,
          2. he did *not* declare the sin ḥalāl (did not legalise it).

- They will be under the Will of Allah:
  - there will be a group of people who committed major sins;
    - Allah may forgive them even if they did not make explicit repentance.

- Hence, it is important to distinguish between:
  - *major sin* and
  - *disbelief (/kufr/)*.
   

* 1. Shirk in the worship of Allah

/Shirk/ (associating partners) in the worship of Allah.

Allah says:

#+begin_quote
“Verily, Allah /does not forgive/ that partners be associated with Him in worship (i.e. Shirk), but He _forgives what is less_ than that to whom He wills.”  
[Surah an‑Nisaa 4:48]
#+end_quote

And He says:
#+begin_quote
“Verily, the one who /mixes partners/ in worship with Allah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made /forbidden/ for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).”  
[Surah al‑Maa’idah 5:72]
#+end_quote

What falls into this is /performing sacrifices/ to someone other than Allah, such as the person who offers a sacrifice to the jinn or to a grave.

* 2. Taking intermediaries between oneself and Allah

Whoever places intermediaries between himself and Allah – calling upon them, asking them for intercession, and placing reliance upon them – has committed disbelief, according to the unanimous agreement (ijmā‘).

* 3. Not declaring the polytheists to be disbelievers

Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, or has doubts about their disbelief, or considers their way and beliefs to be correct, has committed disbelief.

* 4. Believing in guidance or judgement better than that of the Prophet ﷺ

Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is more complete than his guidance, or that someone else’s judgement is better than his judgement – such as the one who prefers the judgement of the tāghūt (false authorities and systems) over his judgement – then he is a disbeliever.

* 5. Hating anything that the Messenger ﷺ came with

Whoever hates something that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) came with – even if he acts upon it – has disbelieved.

* 6. Mocking any part of the religion

Whoever mocks or ridicules anything from the religion of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), or its rewards, or its punishments, has committed disbelief.

Proof:

#+begin_quote
“Say, ‘Was it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuses. You have disbelieved after having had faith.’”  
[Surah at‑Tawbah 9:65‑66]
#+end_quote

* 7. Sorcery (Sihr)

Sorcery, which includes magic spells that cause a person to hate something he seeks (ṣarf) or love something he does not seek (‘aṭf).  

So, whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done has committed disbelief.

Proof:

#+begin_quote
“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had said: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’”  
[Surah al‑Baqarah 2:102]
#+end_quote

* 8. Supporting the disbelievers against the Muslims

Supporting and assisting the polytheists/disbelievers against the Muslims.

Proof:

#+begin_quote
“And whoever amongst you takes them as allies and protectors, then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allah does not guide a wrongdoing people.”  
[Surah al‑Maa’idah 5:51]
#+end_quote

* 9. Believing that some people are exempt from the Shari‘ah of Muhammad ﷺ

Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Sharī‘ah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) – just as it was permitted for al‑Khidr to be free from the Sharī‘ah of Musa (عليه السلام) – then he is a disbeliever.

* 10. Turning away from the religion: not learning or acting

Turning away from the religion of Allah, not learning it, nor acting upon it.

Proof:

#+begin_quote
“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the āyāt (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away from them? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the criminals.”  
[Surah as‑Sajdah 32:22]
#+end_quote

* Important Notes

- There is no difference in these nullifiers between:
  - the one who does them seriously,
  - the one who does them jokingly, or
  - the one who does them out of fear.

- The only exception is the one who does them while being coerced (under compulsion).

All of these ten matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. Therefore, the Muslim must beware of them and fear that he might fall into them.

* Closing Supplication

We seek refuge in Allah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment.

May the peace and blessing be on the best of His creation, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), his family, and his Companions.
