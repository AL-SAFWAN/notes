* The greatest prohibition
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       145f8856-50c8-43f9-adf6-f7f10d234fba
:END:
- The greatest command is to single out Allah in worship and the greatest prohibition is its opposite: shirk
- the first time Allah addressed commands and prohibitions
  - is tawheed and shirk
    - hence these are the greatest obligations to learn so we know what to do and what to stay away from


** Definition of shirk (major)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c97cec0d-c3e3-423f-b7e5-1c805448c7ac
:END:
- to make other than Allah the same as Allah in the exclusive rights of Allah
- to liken the creation to the Creator and the Creator to the creation
  - how is this shirk?
    - it means you have raised the status of the creation
      - e.g. asking the dead
      - e.g. making a sacrifice in someone’s name
      - or:
        - saying something about Allah to the creation
          - lowering the status of Allah with deficiency
    - this takes you out of Islam
      - as you have violated the rights of Allah

** Three major consequences of dying upon shirk
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       54f3e47c-6e9b-403a-bbce-fae8a7125f0b
:END:
- three things about shirk:
*** 1. if you die upon it, it will never be forgiven, and He forgives that which is lesser than it
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6bf82126-f74c-4bce-8256-30f03d6078ea
:END:
- this does not include those who repent from shirk
*** 2. all of the good deeds will be null and void
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       728f83b6-228f-4287-8a63-c8d1434f9943
:END:
- if you do shirk with Allah, it will destroy your deeds
- he will come on the Day of Judgement and will find nothing
*** 3. Jannah will be made haram for him
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       42ec5ff5-98a0-42b7-809d-0725c90ee47b
:END:
- whoever commits shirk, Allah has made Jannah haram for him
  - shirk is a great oppression
    - oppression is to put something other than in its proper place
    - so you have put worship other than in its place

** Fear of shirk even for Ibrahim (عليه السلام)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6883557d-5d1e-4664-a848-e9964c35088e
:END:
- [[id:a759644b-f863-4d85-abd2-578b41f5cd71][Ibrahim]] knew that shirk is something that he might fall into; hence he had fear in his heart
** How shirk entered the earth

*** Fitrah and early generations
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c51e6198-6c99-4433-9e36-a30178286483
:END:
[[id:f471540c-03c7-4454-afdb-6e5effaa1736][I have created My servants as one having a natural inclination to the worship of Allah]] but it is Satan who turns them away from the right religion and he makes unlawful what has been declared lawful for them and he commands them to ascribe partnership with Me, although he has no justification for that 
- every child is born upon the fitrah
- the people were upon tawheed for ten generations/centuries

*** Plot of Shaytan with the righteous
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fc5408ad-c7e9-44e6-b3b3-522fa00b5bb5
:END:
- then Shaytan came and plotted
  - whispering about the pious people
    - “why don’t you hang these people”
      - it will remind you how great he was and it will encourage you more about Allah
        - they started to hang these people up and it reminded them of Allah
          - then after many generations the people said, “look at these statues; surely our fathers worshipped them”
            - Shaytan plans long-term
              - he told them to do something that would bring them closer to Allah
                - after generations this knowledge would be lost

*** Nuh (عليه السلام), first messenger
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       49bf8eb7-eb08-4b0b-9f66-2183dcbdb97e
:END:
- Allah sent the first messenger, Nuh
  - they say he called upon tawheed for 950 years
    - fewer than 20 people accepted the message
  - he was the first messenger
    - then Ibrahim

** From the progeny of Ibrahim to the Arabs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       aed5fbb4-b1e9-4ada-b80e-89cacfb305d1

*** Arabs upon tawheed then turning to shirk
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2e20af7e-3b57-4b04-bc41-c26b39d8bebf
:END:
- then from the progeny of Ibrahim
  - the Arabs were upon the religion of tawheed
    - until a man, ‘Amr ibn ‘Amir ibn Luhay ibn Qusayy
      - he was a noble man and had a high station
        - he went to ash-Sham and saw the shirk that was being committed there and was amazed by it
          - on the shore he saw the idols; some of the scholars say these idols were the idols of Nuh’s people
        - he gathered these idols and brought them to Makkah

*** Consequences of Luhay’s action
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d63a7ed5-fb16-4ce3-8ec0-3513a44bf8a4
:END:
- the Prophet (ﷺ) saw him dragging his intestines in the Fire
- he (ﷺ) destroyed 360 idols
- prophets came generation after generation
  - and he (ﷺ) was the only one who was able to destroy them all
  - indeed the only accepted religion is Islam

** Shirk and du‘a
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3b9a4568-9cc7-4228-865a-f43db1d4f0d2
:END:
*** Shirk as doing acts for other than Allah with Allah
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       604bf875-8a17-4d3d-879c-2a25908006bc
:END:
- shirk is to do acts for other than Allah along with Allah

*** Two types of du‘a
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       37a043af-21f3-41c4-9cf9-7a439e32520c
:END:
- why this definition?
  - there are two types of /du‘a/:
****  /du‘a al-mas’alah/ – the du‘a of asking
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b5c0fcb2-b025-40d4-98bb-4691b95610a2
:END:
- e.g. “O Allah, grant me health”
  - this is also part of /du‘a al-‘ibadah/
****  /du‘a al-‘ibadah/ – the du‘a of worship
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a957ecf2-61f6-4339-9399-a0b6cf178b6e
:END:
- every single act of worship
  - when he is praying, it is as if he is saying “O Allah, accept this salah from me”

** Shirk vs kufr
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       19a3bd81-2904-4e52-8010-55b47a9f9144
:END:
- kufr is disbelief
- shirk is polytheism
  - the principle is:
    - every shirk is kufr
    - not every kufr is shirk
****  major disbelief and major shirk take you out of the fold of Islam
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b2c000cc-b33e-4627-8920-664459304475
:END:
  - there are certain things that take you out of Islam and out of the fold of Islam
    - e.g. insulting the Prophet (ﷺ)

*** Lesser shirk (shirk al-asghar)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e4085932-d422-4599-b7be-4cf2de9f7579
:END:
- /shirk al-asghar/
  - the lesser shirk and lesser kufr
    - they are major sins but do not expel someone from Islam
    - there is no clear single definition for lesser shirk
    - we understand it through examples:
      - to associate and liken something to Allah but not in a complete manner
        - e.g. making an oath by other than Allah
          - unless they want to make the oath to that thing as glorifying it; then it is major shirk
        - to touch a tree for a blessing
        - to hang a talisman is shirk
          - if they believe that the thing itself is what gives the blessing, then this is major shirk
        - denying the blessing of Allah
        - fighting the [[id:a550a44d-78a5-4833-a60c-83cc13bfbf49][Muslim is kufr]]
          - the word /kufr/ here is used harshly, not intending the full meaning of the word, but so it acts as a deterrent
        - the one who [[id:6b3d8c50-ebb7-46ca-aca5-176b0b571b52][cuts the ties of kinship]] will not enter Jannah
          - this does not mean the person is a kafir
      - what the Prophet (ﷺ) feared for the companions
