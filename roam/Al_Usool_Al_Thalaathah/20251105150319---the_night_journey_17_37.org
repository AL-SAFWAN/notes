  The Night Journey (17:37)
  And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height.
  — Saheeh International
  https://quran.com/17/37
  
  *Footnote- 1*
  - Man, for all his arrogance, is yet a weak and small creature.
