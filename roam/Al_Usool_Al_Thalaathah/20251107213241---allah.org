Allah means the one who is deserving to be worshipped, it encompasses all the meaning of every other names of Allah. It is the greatest name of Allah. 

Why Allah encompasses these other names, like Ar-Rahman, because Allah is completely perfect and is deserving of worship. He has to be the Lord, the sustainer, the completely merciful, does not sleep or slumber, if he wasn’t these things, then he would not be deserving of worship.
