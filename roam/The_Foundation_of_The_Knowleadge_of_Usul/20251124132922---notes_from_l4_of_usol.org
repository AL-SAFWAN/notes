  - Absolute Clear Evidence
    - the strongest evidence
      - al ijma', because they have the correct interpretation of the quran and sunnah
        - this ayah means this
          no room for further interpretation
          
  - Correct Deduction
    - a correct approach to decuct rules
  - No Degree of Uncertainty
    100% certain, e.g zina is haram 
    - "ilmun yakin" 100% sure with certainty
      - vast mojority of the rulings are this
    - overwhelling certinity
      
  - Validates Rulings
    
Definition:

“It is the perception of something as it truly is, with firm conviction.”

- For instance, understanding that the whole is greater than the part, or recognising that intention is a prerequisite for the acceptance of worship.


“al-Ilm” implies understanding or comprehending something with certainty, as it actually exists.



*** Overwhelming perception al-dhann
- Overwhelming Perception
  - Possible Ambiguity in Evidence
  - Correct Deduction
  - Small Degree of Uncertainty
  - Validates Rulings if Conditions are met

Definition:
“It is the perception of something with the possibility of a weaker opposing view.”

- al zalbatul zunn
  - small degree of uncerainty due to a ambdigouse the nature of evidence
    - e.g khabar wahid, is raised by the indicator of the narrator to be used as a ruling
      - the oppiste view feel weak
        - why, due to your understanding of hadith
    - e.g a shabah could have the opposing view
    - it could be from 51%-> 99% of cerntating
        - this has conditions

“al-Dhann” in an understanding of something while acknowledging a slight possibility of an opposing or contrary view that is less likely to be true.

e.g the is no marriage without the wali but imaan abu hanifa saw the evidence of aisha saying something like a women can marry herself, but the other school disagree for 98 percent, but they she can marry witout the mahram and it will be valid, but it will be fasid not bastil, zalbatul dhann
