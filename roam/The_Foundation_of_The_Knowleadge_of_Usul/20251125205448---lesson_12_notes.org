* Mutlaq & Muqayyad – Introduction
The concepts of **Mutlaq (absolute/unrestricted)** and **Muqayyad (restricted/specified)**  
are foundational tools in deriving rulings.

* Definitions


* Exercises (From the Slides)

** Case 1
Text 1: List of prohibited marriage relations (Qur’an).  
Mutlaq regarding **breastfeeding relationships**.

Text 2: Aisha’s report — prohibition occurs after **five known sucklings**.

→ The Mutlaq becomes restricted (same hukm, same sabab).

** Case 2
Text 1: “The Prophet cursed the women who visit graves.”  
Text 2: “The Prophet cursed the women who *frequently* visit graves.”

→ Mutlaq becomes restricted to *frequent* visits.

** Case 3
Text 1: Lower garment below ankles “is in the Fire.”  
Text 2: Trailing garment out of *arrogance* — Allah will not look at him.

→ Reason differs → majority: mutlaq becomes restricted by arrogance.  
(Ibn Taymiyyah, Nawawi, many later scholars)

** Case 4
Text 1: “No marriage except with a guardian.”  
Text 2: “No marriage except with a responsible guardian.”

→ Mutlaq is restricted by the description “responsible”.

* Closing

May Allah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad ﷺ, his companions, and those who follow his way. Ameen.
