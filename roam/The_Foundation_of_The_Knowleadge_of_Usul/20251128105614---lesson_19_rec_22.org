4. al-Maṣlaḥah al-Mursalah (المصلحة المرسلة)
5. The law of previous nations – /shar‘ man qablana/ (شرع من قبلنا)

** Statement of Imām al-Shāfiʿī
قال الشافعي: «وجهة العلم: في الكتاب أو السنَّة أو الإجماع أو القياس»
- “The foundation of knowledge is: a report from the Book (the Qur’an),
  or the Sunnah, or consensus (ijmāʿ), or analogy (qiyās).”

* The Sunnah – revision
** Definition of the Sunnah
Arabic:
- =ما صدر عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم غير القرآن من قولٍ أو فعلٍ أو تقريرٍ=

Meaning:
- “Whatever was issued from the Prophet ﷺ other than the Qur’an,
  in the form of:
  - a *statement* (qawl),
  - an *action* (fiʿl),
  - or a *tacit approval* (taqrīr).” :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

** Categories of the Sunnah
- ** (السنة القولية) – Verbal Sunnah
  - His spoken statements.
- ** (السنة الفعلية) – Practical Sunnah
  - His actions.
    - 5/6 rullings from beofore
- *as-Sunnah at-Taqrīriyyah* (السنة التقريرية) – Tacit Sunnah
  - His approvals and silence over actions or statements.

* The Tacit Sunnah – السنة التقريرية
** Definition
- The Prophet’s ﷺ *silence* over a statement or action done in his presence
  (or which he knew of) *without objecting* indicates *permissibility*,
  unless proven otherwise.
  - al-Juwaynī said:
  - “His silence is like his speech; his approval is like his own action.”
- This is a valid legal proof because:
  - the Prophet ﷺ was *obligated* to clarify anything that was wrong or impermissible.
** Types of tacit approval
*** 1. *Direct tacit approval*
- mention in his (ﷺ) prensece 
**** a. *Comprehensive approval*
   - The Prophet ﷺ clearly witnessed or was told of an act and approved it.
     - improve the entire action that was improved
   - *Example*:
     - A man used to recite Sūrat al-Ikhlāṣ in every rakʿah.
     - The Prophet ﷺ approved his action. (al-Bukhārī, Muslim)
       - another exmaple
         - a shahaba, 2 sunnah of fajr after fajr that he missed
           - the prophet (ﷺ) stayed sillence on the whole action to show the approval
             - e.g khalid eating the lizad
               - the voiced being raised by hearing the sound of the adkar of the shabaha, that how people knew it was finihsed  
**** b. *Partial approval*
   - The Prophet ﷺ objected to *some parts* of an act but remained silent about the rest,
     thus approving what he did not object to.
   - *Example*:
     - Young girls were singing on ʿĪd.
     - The Prophet ﷺ did not object to their singing, but clarified the occasion. (al-Bukhārī, Muslim)
       - he didn't object that it wasn't from being the tool of sytaan, but for the young girls singing on the day of eid

***  2 *Indirect tacit approval*
 - An act done during his lifetime that:
   - he did *not personally witness*,
   - but which was *not forbidden* by Allah or His Messenger ﷺ,
     - as Allah would have prohibited for mankind
       - it's a sunnah of Allah to make it permissible in the shari'a, it is Allah's approval as the prophet (ﷺ) was sent at the time of legislation
         - hence the default is permissible 
   - is also considered legally valid.
     - *Examples*:
       - The Companions practised *ʿazl* (coitus interruptus)
         while the Qur’an was being revealed;
         no prohibition was sent down. (al-Bukhārī, Muslim)
         - hence it shows the permissiblity 
       - Eating horse meat:
         - the Companions did so during his time,
         - and it was not forbidden. (al-Bukhārī)
** Legal implications of tacit approval
- Tacit approval carries the *same ruling* as the act itself:
  - If the Prophet ﷺ approved an *act of worship*, it is *legislated* (mashrūʿ).
  - If he approved something as *permissible*, then it is *allowed* (jā’iz).
    - but it's not something that is encorraged or it would have been in the chatpers of ibadat

** Conditions for valid tacit approval
1. The Prophet ﷺ must have *known* of the act, by one of:
   - being physically present,
   - being *informed* of it,
   - or the act being *public knowledge* in his time.
2. The act must be done by a *Muslim*, not by a disbeliever.
3. There must be *no revealed objection* from Allah or His Messenger ﷺ.

- al-Juwaynī said:
  - “His silence is like his speech; his approval is like his own action.”

** Attributing al-Khabar – الخبر
*** Definition of /khabar/
- *Linguistically*:
  - /khabar/ (الخبر) means “a report” or “information”.
  - Plural: *akhbār* (أخبار).
- *Technically*:
  - “A statement that is intrinsically capable of being either *true* or *false*.”

*** Types of reports based on attribution
Reports in ḥadīth literature are categorised according to whom they are attributed:

1. *Marfūʿ* (مرفوع) – Attributed to the Prophet ﷺ
   - Anything attributed directly or indirectly to the Prophet ﷺ.
   - *Explicit marfūʿ*: haqiqah
     - clear statements, actions and approvals of the Prophet ﷺ.
   - *Implied marfūʿ*: hukman
     - what is attributed to his Sunnah or era without directly quoting him.
     - *Example*: Ibn ʿAbbās said,
       - “The people were commanded to make the last thing they do (in ḥajj) the circumambulation of the House…”
       - Though he does not quote the Prophet ﷺ, this is treated as marfūʿ.
         - as what they're doing is only that which the prophet (ﷺ) tought us 

2. *Mawqūf* (موقوف) – Attributed to a Companion
   - A report that stops at a *Companion* (Ṣaḥābī),
     without being raised to the Prophet ﷺ.
   - *Companion* definition:
     - One who met the Prophet ﷺ as a believer and died upon that belief.

3. *Maqṭūʿ* (مقطوع) – Attributed to a Tābiʿī or later
   - A report attributed to a *Tābiʿī* (Successor) or anyone after them.
   - *Tābiʿī* definition:
     - One who met a Companion while believing in the Prophet ﷺ and died upon that belief. 



* Closing
Imām al-Qarāfī said:
- “He who does not study *uṣūl al-fiqh* is prohibited from issuing fatwas,
  for he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts,
  nor how to restrict and specify general directives.”

And may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and the seal of the Prophets,
Muḥammad, his Companions and all those who follow his way. *Āmīn.*
