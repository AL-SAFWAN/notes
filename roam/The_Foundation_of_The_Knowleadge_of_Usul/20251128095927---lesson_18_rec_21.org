  1. The Qur’an (القرآن)
  2. The Sunnah (السنة)
  3. Consensus – /ijmāʿ/ (الإجماع)
  4. Analogy – /qiyās/ (القياس)

- *Disputed evidences* (أدلة مختلف عليها):
  1. The shādh recitation (القراءة الشاذة)
  2. Statements of the Companions (قول الصحابي)
  3. Juristic preference – /al-istiḥsān/ (الاستحسان)
  4. Unrestricted public interest – /al-maṣlaḥah al-mursalah/ (المصلحة المرسلة)
  5. The law of previous nations – /sharʿ man qablana/ (شرع من قبلنا)

- Statement of Imām al-Shāfiʿī:
  - «وَجْهَةُ العِلْمِ: فِي الْكِتَابِ أَوِ السُّنَّةِ أَوِ الْإِجْمَاعِ أَوِ الْقِيَاسِ»
  - “The foundation of knowledge is: a report from the Book (the Qur’an),
    or the Sunnah, or consensus, or analogy.”

* The Sunnah (السنة)
                
* Categories of the Prophet’s ﷺ actions


* KILL al-Khabar (الخبر) – reports
** Definition
- *Linguistically*:  
  - /khabar/ means “report” or “information”; plural: *akhbār* (أخبار).
- *Technically*:
  - “A statement that is, in itself, capable of being either true or false.”

** Types of khabar by attribution
1. *Marfūʿ* (مرفوع) – attributed to the Prophet ﷺ
   - Includes:
     - his explicit statements,
     - his actions,
     - his tacit approvals,
     - or anything linked to his era in a way that indicates it is part of his Sunnah.

2. *Mawqūf* (موقوف) – attributed to a Companion
   - A report stopping at a *Ṣaḥābī*.
   - The Companion:
     - met the Prophet ﷺ as a believer and died upon that belief.

3. *Maqṭūʿ* (مقطوع) – attributed to a Tābiʿī or later
   - A report traced to a *Successor* (Tābiʿī) or anyone after them.
   - A Tābiʿī:
     - met a Companion as a believer in the Prophet ﷺ and died upon that belief.


* Categories of khabar with respect to transmission
** 1. Mutawātir (متواتر) – mass-transmitted
- Definition:
  - Narrated by such a *large number* of narrators, at every level of the chain,
    that it is inconceivable they agreed upon a lie,
    and it is based on their *direct sensory perception*.
- Types:
  1. *Verbal mutawātir* (التواتر اللفظي):
     - narrators agree on both *wording* and *meaning*.
     - Example:
       - ḥadith: “Whoever lies upon me deliberately, let him prepare his seat in the Fire,”
         narrated by many Companions.
  2. *Meaning-based mutawātir* (التواتر المعنوي):
     - narrations differ in wording but agree on a *shared meaning*.
     - Example:
       - numerous ḥadiths about wiping over the leather socks (khuffayn).

** 2. Āḥād (آحاد) – solitary reports
- Definition:
  - Any report that does *not* reach the level of mutawātir,
    even if narrated by several people.
- Note:
  - The *majority* of aḥādīth fall into this category. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

* Classification of reports by authenticity
Reports (/akhbār/) are also classified in terms of strength:

1. *Ṣaḥīḥ* (صحيح) – authentic
   - Conditions:
     1. Narrated by a *trustworthy*, upright narrator.
     2. Possessing *precise memory* (or reliable written preservation).
     3. Chain is *connected* back to the Prophet ﷺ.
     4. Free from *shudhūdh* (irregularity) – it does not contradict stronger evidence.
     5. Free from *ʿillah* (hidden defects).

2. *Ḥasan* (حسن) – fair / sound
   - Similar to ṣaḥīḥ but:
     - the level of precision is *slightly lower*.
   - Still:
     - narrators are upright,
     - chain is connected,
     - free from serious irregularities or defects.
   - Some scholars considered ḥasan a *subset* of ṣaḥīḥ.

3. *Ḍaʿīf* (ضعيف) – weak
   - Any report that *fails* to meet the conditions of ṣaḥīḥ or ḥasan.
   - Causes of weakness may include:
     - missing links in the chain,
     - weak or unknown narrators,
     - clear contradictions or defects.

** Use of each category in deriving rulings
- *Ṣaḥīḥ* and *ḥasan* reports:
  - Accepted as *proof* in deriving legal rulings from the Sunnah.
- *Ḍaʿīf* reports:
  - Not valid as *independent* evidence for legislation.
  - Some scholars allow *limited* use in:
    - faḍāʾil al-aʿmāl (virtuous deeds),
    - admonitions and encouragements,
    - under strict conditions (e.g. not very weak; falls under a general accepted principle).

* Closing
Imām al-Qarāfī said:
- “He who does not study *uṣul al-fiqh* is prohibited from issuing fatwas,
  for he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts,
  nor how to restrict and specify general directives.”

And may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and the seal of the Prophets,
Muḥammad, his Companions and all those who follow his way. *Āmīn.*
