#+title: The metaphor 

* Definition
A metaphor (majaz) is when:
- a word is used for other than its original, literal meaning,
- with evidence that the literal meaning is not intended.

- Example: Calling a brave man “a lion”.
- Exclusion:
  - The definition applies only to words actually used in speech.
  - It does not include:
    - unused words,
    - or cases where the word is used in its literal (real) sense.

* Conditions for metaphor

the default position of all words, is we always apply literal meaning
the default position of all words in the context of Islam is the shar'i meanings

The metaphor are only applied based on, two key conditions are required:

1. There must be evidence (qarinah)
   - Some contextual indicator that prevents us from understanding the literal meaning.
   - Without this, we assume the literal meaning is intended.
   - Evidence in the law of Allah to make it impressible to use the literal meaning

2. There must be a "link" between the literal and metaphorical meanings
   - This connection keeps the expression meaningful.
   - The link can be through similarity or another recognised relation.
     
** 1.Borrowed metaphor (al-istiʿārah)
- A type of linguistic majāz (al-majāz al-lughawī المجاز اللغوي)
  where the ʿalāqah is similarity (ʿalāqat al-mushābahah علاقة المشابهة).
  
based on similarity
- The *link* between the real and metaphorical meanings is similarity.
- Example:
  - Calling a brave man “a lion”.
  - The word “lion” is borrowed from the animal and applied to the man due to similarity in bravery.

** 2. Metonymic metaphor  (al-majāz al-mursal)
- A type of linguistic majāz where the ʿalāqah is *not* similarity
  (ʿalāqah ghayr al-mushābahah علاقة غير المشابهة).
based on non-similarity
- The *link* is *not* based on similarity.
  - 'psychological metaphor' when it happen in attribution.
- The relationship may be:
  - cause ↔ effect,
  - part ↔ whole,
  - place ↔ people,
- Example:
  - Saying “we took care of the rain” intending “we took care of the pasture”.
  - The word is shifted from one related thing to another.
    
** 3. Logical or psychological metaphor (al-majāz al-ʿaqli)
- Here the majāz is in the *attribution* (isnād إسناد), not in a single word.

based on non-similarity
- The metaphor occurs in the *attribution*, not in the word itself.
- Example:
  - “The rain caused the pastures to grow.”
  - Literally, growth is created by Allah, but it is attributed to rain as a cause.
  - The words them


* Metaphor by addition and omission
These are examples of how metonymic usage can involve:
- adding a word for emphasis,
- or omitting a word for brevity and style.
** Addition example
Verse meaning: “There is none like Him” (42:11).

- An extra element (like “like”) serves to:
  - emphasise the complete negation of any resemblance to Allah,
  - strengthen the meaning.
- The letter *'kaf* is added to emphasise the negation of anything resembling Allah the Most High

** Omission example
Verse meaning: “Ask the village” (12:82).

- Intended meaning: “Ask the people of the village.”
- The word “people” is omitted for rhetorical effect.
  - The wording focuses on the place to mean its inhabitants.

* Scholarly discussion on metaphor in the Qur'an
- Many later scholars accept the division of speech into real and metaphorical in:
  - the Qur'an,
  - and other texts.
- Some scholars, however, held that:
  - there is *no* metaphor in the Qur'an,
  - and some extended this to all revealed texts.
- This view is reported from:
  - Abu Ishaq al-Isfaraini,
  - and later supported by scholars such as Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti,
  - and strongly argued by Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim.

Their argument:
- The technical concept of “majaz” as later defined was not known in the first three generations,
- so Qur’anic language should be understood as entirely “literal” within its revealed usage.
- which becomes apparent upon closer examination that this is the correct option.
