3. *Preserving the Qur’an during the life of the Prophet ﷺ*
   - Recited, taught and revised with the Companions.
   - Written down by the scribes of revelation and memorised by many of the Companions.

* Defining al-Qirā’āt (القراءات)
** Definition
Arabic definition:
- «عِلْمٌ يُعْرَفُ بِهِ كَيْفِيَّةُ أَدَاءِ كَلِمَاتِ الْقُرْآنِ، وَوُجُوهُهَا اخْتِلَافًا وَاتِّفَاقًا، مَعَ عَزْوِ كُلِّ وُجْهٍ إِلَى نَاقِلِهِ»

Meaning:
- A science by which one learns:
  - the correct manner of pronouncing the words of the Qur’an,
  - the various accepted ways of reciting them (agreement and variation),
  - and by which each mode of recitation is attributed to its specific transmitter (qāriʾ and rāwī).
    
* al-ʿArḍah al-Ākhīrah (الْعَرْضَةُ الْأَخِيرَةُ) – The Final Presentation
- Took place:
  - In the *final year* of the Prophet’s ﷺ life.
  - During *Ramaḍān*.
- It was the *last mutual recitation* (mu‘āraḍah) between:
  - the Prophet ﷺ and the angel Jibrīl (ʿalayhi s-salām).
- In this review:
  - Each recited the entire Qur’an to the other *twice* (4 time in total).
    - in hadith of aisha, and she cried because she knew what it meant
  - It affirmed the *final, precise form* of the Qur’an in memorisation and arrangement.
- Importance:
  - Became the *authoritative reference* for the Companions.
  - Zayd ibn Thābit (raḍiyallāhu ʿanhu) attended this review and relied on it later when compiling the Qur’an under Abū Bakr and ‘Uthmān.
    - heard of it 4 times
      the last sitting the final sitting
      - to afirm what was afirmed and clear that  
      - all of it was presevered as it's final form and return to it's orginal harff
        - after this it was all the same
          - may shaba had writen it in the order of revevilation
            - this is because it was still being reveled
  - Ensured that what the Ummah holds today is exactly what was preserved in the heart of the Prophet ﷺ and affirmed by Jibrīl.

* Abū Bakr’s compilation of the Qur’an
** Why the Qur’an was compiled in a single codex
- After the Prophet’s ﷺ passing, preservation of the Qur’an became a pressing issue.
- Although:
  - many Companions had memorised the Qur’an,
  - and portions were already written,
  - the risk of loss increased due to battles.

- *Key trigger*:
  - The Battle of Yamāmah:
    - 500-700 
      - A large number of *qurrā’* (reciters, memorizers) were martyred.
        - include salim and other specalist
      - Raised serious concern about losing parts of the Qur’an if no action was taken.

** Key stages during the caliphate of Abū Bakr (raḍiyallāhu ʿanhu)
1. *Consultation and ijmā‘ of the Companions*
   - ‘Umar suggested compiling the Qur’an into one codex.
     - he came to zayb bin thabit, and then told abu bakr, he said how can i do that, if the prophet (ﷺ) didn't tell me.
       - he said it would have been easier to move the mountain
         - and he began to combine from all the differnt source
   - After initial hesitation, Abū Bakr agreed when he recognised the maslaḥah.
   - The Companions came to consensus on this project.

2. *Commissioning Zayd ibn Thābit*
   - Zayd was:
     - from the scribes of revelation,
     - a reliable memoriser,
     - and close to the Prophet ﷺ.
   - He was appointed to lead the compilation.

3. *Verification and collection*
   - Strict criteria:
     - Verses had to be confirmed:
       - from memorisation,
       - from written records,
       - and by *two reliable witnesses*.

4. *Final compilation and storage*
   - The collected sheets (*ṣuḥuf*) formed a single authenticated manuscript.
   - It remained with:
     - Abū Bakr,
     - then ‘Umar,
     - then with Ḥafṣah bint ‘Umar (raḍiyallāhu ʿanhum).

* The methodology of Abū Bakr in compiling the Qur’an
1. *Collection from primary sources*
   - Every Companion who had received any part of the Qur’an directly from the Prophet ﷺ was summoned.
     - he was made to sit at the door of the haram
       - and he was asked them what they have memroise and command them to look if they have written it correctly 
2. *Cross-verification*
   - Memorised portions were compared with the written records made during the Prophet’s ﷺ life.

3. *Testimony requirement*
   - Two trustworthy witnesses were required for each portion:
     - written in the Prophet’s ﷺ presence, or
     - confirmed as part of the final review (al-ʿarḍah al-ākhīrah).
   - Abū Bakr’s instruction:
     - “Sit at the door of the masjid; if anyone brings you two witnesses for any part of the Book of Allah, then write it down.”

4. *Ordered compilation*
   - Verses and sūrahs were written:
     - only after full verification,
       - after the 3 condtion then he started to write down
         - hence each ayah is mutawatir 6-70  
       - in the exact order taught by the Prophet ﷺ.

5. *Outcome*: an authenticated and preserved Qur’anic manuscript.
   - just before the death of the prphet (ﷺ)
     - took about 15 month
he had doubt about the last ayah, because there was only one person who had written it down 
- quzaib ibn thabit
  - he was someone who was a witness during a transaction
    - ( he said you are the messenger of allah why would i need a witness for you so i have witness for you)
    - then the messenger of Allah said form this day his witness is equal to two witness
      
* Key features of Abū Bakr’s compilation
1. *Meticulous verification*
   - Only verses recognised *unanimously* as Qur’an and transmitted by *tawātur* were included.

2. *Unified manuscript*
   - The Qur’an was gathered into a single codex (*muṣḥaf*),
   - with both verse order and sūrah arrangement preserved.

3. *Conformity with the final review*
   - The codex matched the *ʿarḍah al-ākhīrah*.
   - Verses whose recitation had been *abrogated* were excluded.

4. *Inclusion of the seven aḥruf*
   - The codex allowed for recitation in the seven *aḥruf* (dialectal modes).
     - only remove the abrogated verse

5. *Unanimous acceptance*
   - The Companions accepted this compilation as complete and sound,
   - free from addition or omission.

* ‘Uthmān’s compilation of the Qur’an
** Historical context
- During Abū Bakr’s time, the aim was *collection* into one codex.
- Some Companions still had private manuscripts:
  - with personal notes, explanations, du‘ā’s, and non-Qur’anic additions beside Qur’anic text.

- As the Muslim lands expanded:
  - Companions spread to different regions.
  - People began reciting according to various Companions and aḥruf:
    - People of Syria: recitation of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b.
    - People of Iraq: recitation of ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd.
    - Others: recitation of Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī.
  - This led to:
    - differing pronunciations,
    - variations in style,
    - and disputes among people who had not heard directly from the Prophet ﷺ.

** The issue of divergence
- Differences sometimes escalated into:
  - accusations of error and even *takfīr* (heresy).
- Ḥudhayfah ibn al-Yamān:
  - Witnessed these differences during the campaigns of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
  - Feared a division like that of Jews and Christians.
  - Urged ‘Uthmān (raḍiyallāhu ʿanhu) to act.

** ‘Uthmān’s decision and actions
1. *Standardisation project*
   - ‘Uthmān requested the ṣuḥuf from Ḥafṣah.
   - Appointed a committee:
     - Zayd ibn Thābit, (quraishi)
     - ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr, 
     - Sa‘īd ibn al-‘Āṣ, (quraishi, knew the grammar, a master in it)
     - ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām.  
2. *Writing in the dialect of Quraysh*
   only harf that wasnt abrogated
   - but write it to accomidate the different the qirat
   - If the committee differed on wording, they wrote it according to:
     - the dialect of Quraysh,
     - as the Qur’an had been revealed in their dialect.

3. *Distribution and removal of variants*
   - Multiple official *muṣḥafs* were copied.
   - ‘Uthmān sent these copies to the major regions.
   - Ordered that other personal codices and variant copies be burnt or destroyed,
     - to prevent future dispute.
    
* The methodology of ‘Uthmān in compiling the Qur’an
- *Source of compilation*:
  - The ṣuḥuf compiled under Abū Bakr by Zayd ibn Thābit were used as the master copy.

- *Caliphal oversight*:
  - ‘Uthmān personally supervised the process and resolved any disagreements.

- *Clarification and consultation*:
  - The committee consulted ‘Uthmān and other Companions on questions of wording and phrasing.

- *Caution and verification*:
  - Authentic modes of recitation were carefully included.
  - They ensured no alteration to Qur’anic content.

- *Script and qirā’āt*:
  - Muṣḥafs were written:
    - without diacritical marks or vowel points,
    - in a way that could accommodate the various accepted qirā’āt.

- *Consistency in dialect*:
  - Any disagreement in writing a word was resolved:
    - by adopting the Qurayshī dialect.

- *Result*:
  - Preservation of the Qur’an in a complete, authentic, unified form.
  - Prevention of future disputes over divergent readings.

* Categories of rulings in the Qur’an
1. *Doctrinal rulings* (ʿaqīdah)
   - Beliefs about:
     - Allāh,
     - His angels,
     - His books,
     - His messengers,
     - the Last Day,
     - and divine decree (al-qadar).

2. *Ethical rulings*
   - Morals and character traits:
     - justice, excellence, truthfulness, patience, etc.

3. *Practical rulings* (ʿamaliyyah)
   1. *Acts of worship* (ʿibādāt):
      - prayer, fasting, zakāh, ḥajj, etc.
   2. *Social and civil transactions* (muʿāmalāt):
      - personal status (marriage, divorce),
      - civil and commercial dealings (contracts, sales),
      - criminal law (ḥudūd, qiṣāṣ, taʿzīr),
      - judicial procedures and court rulings.

* Types of rulings in the Qur’an – level of detail
1. *Detailed elucidation of certain rulings*
   - Some areas are explained with great detail and near-completeness, such as:
     - theological discussions (ʿaqīdah and their evidences),
     - inheritance laws,
     - many rulings of family law,
     - legal punishments (ḥudūd),
     - expiations (kaffārāt).

2. *General clarification of remaining rulings*
   - Many rulings are mentioned *generally*, not in exhaustive detail.
   - The Qur’an lays down:
     - broad principles and foundations,
     - without specifying all pillars, conditions, or modalities.
   - Examples:
     - Command to pray, give zakāh, fast, and perform ḥajj:
       - method, number of units, and detailed conditions are explained by the Sunnah.
     - Civil, international, criminal, constitutional matters:
       - guided by general principles of justice, consultation, fulfilling trusts, etc.

* Closing counsel – importance of studying Usul al-Fiqh
- Imām al-Qarāfī said:
  - “He who does not study *uṣūl al-fiqh* is prohibited from issuing fatwas,
    for he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts,
    nor how to restrict and specify general directives.”

* Closing
And may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and the seal of the Prophets, Muhammad, his Companions, and all those who follow his way. *Āmīn.*
