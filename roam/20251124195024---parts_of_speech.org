Speech is divided, with regard to its potential for truthfulness into two par al-khabr (news) and al-insha (that which is established)

- al-khabr (informative)
- al-insha (non-informative, but performative)
  - Commandments
  - Prohibitions
  - Questions

based on the type is how you'll abstract the rulings
