#+title: Shakk (Doubt)

- Doubt
  - Lack of Clear Evidence
  - Unable to Deduct a Ruling
  - Great Uncertainty
  - Cannot Validate rulings

Definition:
“It is the perception of something with the possibility of an equal opposing view.”
  
- this is 50% of certainty

  
“Shak” describes a situation where one understands or perceives something but is equally aware of a contrary or opposing possibility that has the same weight or likelihood. Essentially, there is no clear preference or certainty because both the perception and its opposite hold equal validity or probability.
