The phrase "and how to make full use of them" (wa kayfiyat ul-istifadata minha) refers to the understanding and application of methodologies that enables a jurist ([[id:0e48c744-3e6e-4d6a-9b43-5a43daf938e1][faqih]]) to extract and apply rulings from the legal evidences efficiently.

This involves analysing the language of the text, discerning nuances such as the general from the specific, the conditional from the unconditional, and identifying instances of abrogation.

Such skill are essential for a faqih to effectively interpret and implement the evidence in deriving coherent and applicable legal ruling from the foundational text of fiqh.
