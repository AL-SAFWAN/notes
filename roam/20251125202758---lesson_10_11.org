* Specific Texts / Terms
** Definition
"A word that specifies a general term to restrict it to a person or a certain number."
- e.g everyone stand up excetp the one who is wearing the hat
  - this is how the specific terms works
    - based on a condtion
      - everyoen stand up except the one who has eaten
        - by description
          - who has memories stand up
  - there are specific text that specifc exception from the general ruling
  
** Ruling
- Scholars agree: specific terms definitively indicate their meaning.
- The legal ruling of a specific referent must be acted upon.
- general term works with specifics
  - iman shafiee said every general term has is specific so we should know it, every general has their specifics
    - hence be aware of both
      
** How Specific Terms Work
1. Allah commands a specific act of worship.
   - and worship allah
     - establish a the prayer and zakat
2. Allah prohibits a specific act.
   - don't come close to zina
     - don't steal, lying and sladering
       
3. Allah specifies a number of times an act is done.
   - eg pray 5 times 
4. Allah lifts the rule of a general term for:
   - a group
   - a person
   - a number of occurrences
   - what does this mean
     - a new rule is made for these peole
       - this is kalled at-taksis
** Examples
1. Commanding a specific act
   - {أقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة واركعوا مع الراكعين} (2:43)
     every comanded is a request to do it 
2. Prohibiting a specific act
   - {ولا تقتلوا النفس التي حرم الله إلا بالحق} (17:33)
     every prohibition is a request to leave it
     
3. Specifying number

   - Fasting *three* days (2:196)

** Two Main Types
1. *Connected* (المتصل – al-Mukhassas al-Muttasil)
- connected to the sentence
2. *Separate* (المنفصل – al-Mukhassas al-Munfasil)
- not wihtint the same sentence, but sepcified else where
  
** al-Mukhassas al-Muttasil — Connected Specifier
Occurs *within the same sentence or context.*
e.g. all of mankind is lost expect those who believek

Includes:
1. Istithna’ (exception)
2. Sifah (description/attribute)
3. Shart (condition)
   
*** 1. Istithna’ – Exception
Example (Qur’an):
- {من كفر بالله من بعد إيمانه إلا من أكره...}
   - used in the same sentence

Example (Sunnah):
- “Its trees shall not be cut *except* idhkhir grass.”
 - all tree the exception is idkhir gress (used for roofing)  

*** 2. Sifah – Descriptive Attribute
Example:
- Marriage to believing slave women (4:25)
  - if you are too poor then marry a muslim slave
    - the slave is described as a muslim
      - not any
        - hence it is restricted
          
- Zakat on “freely grazing” sheep
  - if you thought of all the sheep the type
    - but is has been described with restriction on the freely grazing 
    - e.g the tired ones stand up 
*** 3. Shart – Condition
Example:
- Husband inherits half *if* she has no children (4:12)
  - was spereate by a condtion
--
- e.g the worst peole became the best peple
  - if they learn
- these are found within the same statnece   

** al-Mukhassas al-Munfasil — Separate Specifier
The restricting evidence comes from *another text*, not the same sentence.

* Examples & Scenarios
(From slides)

* Statement of Imam al-Qarafi
"He who does not study usul al-fiqh is prohibited from issuing fatwas, for he does not know how to distinguish between different concepts, nor how to restrict and specify general directives."

* Closing
May Allah’s peace and blessings be upon Muhammad ﷺ, his companions, and all who follow his way. Ameen.
